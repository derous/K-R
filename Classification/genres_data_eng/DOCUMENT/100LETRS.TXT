to court and, therefore, have decided to extend your
credit for ___ (amount of time) -- ___ (number of days).

	To avoid legal action, we must have your check for

Dear Sir or Madam:

	The ____ (firm, company, association) mentioned in your
letter of ____ , l9__, (date) has had very few dealings with us.

	This is a reliable and reputable firm as far as we know

I wish I could but I cannot!

When _____ (firm's name) set up the ____ (year) price schedule
in the ____ (season), we  tried to keep the prices on each item
as low as possible.  We also set up a discount based on the
quantit˘ purchasesÆ  WÂ  explaine‰ to our customers that these
pricing schedules were based equitably on maximum value.
So you can see, if we charged your shipment less, we would
have to charge someone else's shipment more.  And that would be
unfair to our other customers!

I know that you will understand our one-price policy.  This is,
obviously, the only fair way that we can operate.  It is a policy
that assures all our customers the maximum value for every
dollar that they spend.

					Sincerely,

Dear _____ (name):

	I find it rather difficult to answer your letter about
_____ (name).  I like him personally but in fairness I cannot
recommend him to you.

	Without a doubt ________ (name) is a talented young man.
He was (position held) with us for ____ (period of time) and
he certainly knows his business and can do a fine job when he
wants to.

	But that's where his difficulty arrives - he does not
always want to.  Instead, he starts to drink and then he becomes
very undependable.  He will literally walk out of the job for
a period of ____ (time period) and let somebody else take over.
In fact, that is why he is no longer employed with us.

	These facts really distress me because ____ (name of person)
is very talented and has great ability.  In fact, he would probably
be one of the best _____ (name of position) if he did not drink.

	Perhaps if you discussed the situation with him and told him
that he would be fired if he drank, that might make a difference.
I think this would be a worthwhile approach because he has so much
to offer.

	If I can answer any other questions, please do not hesitate
to contact me.
