This is a Frequently Asked Questions list for alt.supermodels.  It
tries to address the standard questions, so the regular readers won't
have to see them again.  The info is mostly drawn from postings to this
group, but a lot has been contributed directly.  There's a lot of data
about people who aren't supermodels, because people ask a lot of
questions about people who aren't supermodels.  However, I've tried to
omit most of the people who aren't models at all.  This list is not
guaranteed to be complete, accurate, useful, grammatically sound, or
spelled correctly.

If you have any data that belongs here, _please_ send it to
scott@udel.edu.  Comments and suggestions are also welcome.  I'll keep
contributions anonymous unless you explicitly ask to be credited.

This FAQ particularly needs hard data; addresses (fashion houses,
magazines, catalogs, fan clubs, etc), birthdates, measurements, earning
power, etc.

[ I'd like to get some more info on the educational or business
achievements of current and retired supermodels.  I'm hoping some
examples will help quiet the "supermodels are/aren't brainless" flames.
For example, Crawford was pulling A's in North-Western's
engineering program before becoming a model. ]

Lists of models and data.
    These people have been mentioned on this group.  Some are
    supermodels.  The rest have some claim to being models, but
    aren't famous enough yet to rate a "super".

    [ Since there is now an alt.celebrities group, the non-models,
    playmates, actresses, etc. have been removed from here. ]

    [ Several people have requested that male models be added to this
    list.  I'm not sure any of them have the name recognition or
    earning power of the mainstream female "supermodels", or that they
    will ever attain it.  However, several of the female models listed
    here will probably never become "super" models either.  So, I am
    adding men.  Unfortunately, I don't really have any data on them.
    Can anyone help? ]

    [ I'm not going to list every movie a model has made, because
    I can't do it effectively.  I'll just list a couple 'star maker'
    roles, and leave the full lists to the movie experts listed in
    the next section of this FAQ. ]

    Bust-waist-hips: 34B-24-35

    Shoe size: 9-1/2
    Born: 20 Feb 1966 in De Kalb, Illinois, USA
    Agency: Elite
    Probably the single most widely recognized supermodel.  Cindy was
    the spokesperson for Pepsi for a while, has her own exercise video,
    and her own show on MTV.  She's also done at least three calendars,
    and of the profit, half (I believe) goes toward fighting leukemia.
    Had a three year $3 million contract with Revlon.  Also appeared in
    print ads for JH Collectables and Capezio Bags.  She appeared in
    a series of lingerie posters for Hennes & Mauritz in Europe.  The
    Norway police tore many of them down because they feared drivers
    were being too distracted.  She has said she feels too old for
    runway modeling, and wishes to cut back to part time modelling.

    Cindy is not doing any calendar for 1994.  She is said to be busy
    doing and promoting her exercise/work-out video.  The same company
    who made the last 4 calendars has brought out the Cindy Crawford
    1994 European Edition Calendar which has various pics taken from
    her last four calendars.  Also, there is another calendar produced
    by an English firm which is of fairly poor quality (its only 12
    month while the European Edition is 16 months).
    [ Addresses for the two companies, CULTRE SHOCK and DAY DREAM
    CALENDARS, are in the addresses section of this FAQ. ]

    She was married to actor Richard Gere in Dec '91 at the Little
    Church of the West in Las Vegas, by Rev.  Wes McPherson.  They
    using wedding bands twisted from chewing gum wrappers.  Cindy
    said, during an interview, they plan on having a child soon.

    Cindy is frequently rumored to be bisexual, and having an affair
    with Christy Turlington.  In '91, they were photographed while
    kissing behind the Roxy nightclub in New York.  The rumors have
    intensified since Cindy appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair
    shaving k.d. lang, a confirmed lesbian.

    Appeared topless in the July 1988 Playboy.  Quote: "I don't mind if
    someone thinks a picture of me decorates their wall nicely.  It's
    weird when you think what people might be doing to it.  But if just
    the way I look can make someone feel good, that's a pretty easy way
    for me to bring them some pleasure.  I just don't want to hear
    about graphics details, you know." US April 1993.

    Kristen was a fairly normal model, basically just another beautiful
    face.  However, without any trademark, her career was a disaster.

    eyebrows.  Since then she's been doing much better.  She has been
    described as an antimodel, and is typical of the grunge models.

    Born: 16 Jan 74 in Addiscomb, Surrey, England
    Earning power: $10000 / day
    Agency: Women Model Management
    One of the more controversial supermodels, primarily because of her
    unusually low weight (she typifies the "waif" models).  Some people
    feel she is unattractively thin, and fear idolizing her may cause
    anorexia in impressionable teenage girls.  However, she also has a
    large number of fans, and receives a large number of modeling jobs.
    Her contract with Calvin Klein is supposedly worth over 1 million.
    Her unusual appearance (and possibly her willingness to appear
    nude, "It's just work") have, in a very short time, made her almost
    as widely recognized as Cindy Crawford.  She is a little too short
    and thin to model clothes designed for the "standard" model's
    build.  This makes her less versatile and may limit her career's
    lifespan.  She appeared in an '89 British sexploitation film "The
    Inferno".  She chain smokes Marlboros.  She has broken with her
    photographer boyfriend, Mario Sorrenti.

Mulder, Karen
    Height: 5'10"
    Bust-waist-hips: 34.5-24-34.5
    Dress size: 6
    Hair color: Blonde
    Eye color: Blue
    Shoe size: 8
    Agency: Elite
    One of the most popular blonde models of the moment.  Appeared in
    the requisite Guess?  ads in 1991 (I think).  She is Dutch and
    married to Rene Bosne.  She can be seen everywhere!

Munro, Carol
    Retired.

Ogilvie, Lana
    Nationality: Canadian
    will soon appear in the upcoming Cover Girl ads
    for their new line of cosmetics for darker skinned models.

Otis, Carr'e
    Born: Sep 28 1968 in San Francisco, California, USA
    Former boyfriend was Mickey Rourke.  Carrie has five tattoos - a
    rose on her right ankle, a Japanese peace sign above the rose, a
    Tibetan symbol on her left ankle, a large angle on her back and a
    Native American Thunderbird on her wrist.  About two years ago she
    accidentally shot herself under her left arm when a firearm she was
    carrying went off in her purse.  Carrie appeared in the infamous
    movie Wild Orchid where she was reported to be having real sex on
    screen with then boyfriend Mickey Rourke.  She can be seen in some
    equally infamous Calvin Klein jeans ads that came out in '92.  The
    story line for the ads was her travelling with a band, appearing

Common questions and answers not handled in the previous section.

What is a supermodel?
    This is a major point of discussion in this group.  Some factors
    that may be involved are earning power, name recognition, face
    recognition, frequency of runway appearances, frequency of magazine
    covers, appearances in Sports Illustrated, calenders, TV
    appearances, movies.  Also see the "history and purpose" section
    of this FAQ.

Why are all (or most) supermodels tall and thin?
    There are variations, but most models are about the same size,
    height (~5'9), and weight.

    Most of the designs are for very thin women (why is another good
    question).  Tall women appear thinner than short ones.

    Women with small faces are supposed to photograph "better". If
    you put a head on a woman who is 5'10" - 6', it will look smaller
    than the same beautiful head on a woman who is 5'2" or so.

    Designers can sew clothes for the "standard" model.  Then they can
    easily substitute models if they think a particular dress would
    look better with a different model, or someone is late for a show.

    Uniformity lets them "ensemble" well with other models.  No one
    has to stand on box.  The standard height may be on the tall side
    to ease posing with men.

Who's the woman in the Meatloaf video?
    Dana Patrick.  However, the voice belongs to a woman identified
    only as "Mrs. Loud".

What's the name of the magazine Alyssa Milano posed nude in?
    The complete title is "Bikini".

Who is the girl in the Aerosmith videos?
    Alicia Silverstone was in the Aerosmith vidoes "Cryin'" and
    "Amazing", and starred in the movie, "The Crush".  She's 17.

Sources of additional movie appearance information.
    A lot of information about model's movie appearances is available
    from the movie database servers.  One of the best is "Cardiff's
    Movie Database Browser", available through the Web with URL:
    "http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk/Movies/moviequery.html"


#####################
How to download and view the pictures.
    Read the FAQ for alt.binaries.pictures.d.  If your site doesn't get
    that group, or expires it quickly, look in news.answers, or ftp it
    from rtfm.mit.edu.  Jim Howard has done an excellent job of
    explaining this, much better than I could.  He describes the
    necessary steps and programs on a wide variety of systems, and
    tells you where to find them on the net.

    Supermodel pictures are usually available in
    alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels (usually abbreviated a.b.p.s or
    abps) and alt.binaries.pictures.erotica (abpe).


#####################
Where to get pictures of supermodels on the net.
    Picture files can be obtained over the internet using ftp, fsp, or
    mail to one of the ftp-by-mail servers.  For more info, see Tom
    Czarnik's "FTP List - FAQ" posting to news.answers.

    There are NO ftp sites carrying nude pictures of supermodels or
    anyone else.  Every time one opens, 328959802 guys try to ftp to it
    at once, it's load goes to infinity, and it's admin deletes the
    pictures in self defense.  There are lots of sites that keep G and
    PG rated pictures of supermodels.  A couple of the more popular
    ones are below, use archie, or check the ftp FAQ for a complete
    list.

    Some FTP servers with supermodel info are:
  einstein.mse.lehigh.edu:/gif
  erratic.bradley.edu: via fsp only
  garfield.catt.ncsu.edu:/pub/graphics/images/girls
  louie.udel.edu:/pub/supermodels
      louie only has small "mug-shot" pictures of supermodel's faces,
      some copies of the posted lists of where to find pictures of
      particular supermodels, archives of this newsgroup, and this FAQ.
  nic.funet.fi:/pub/pics/gif/pics/sport
      only if you can access it via NORDUnet
  wuarchive.wustl.edu:/graphics/gif

    Some gopher and web servers with supermodel info are:
  http://louie.udel.edu/supermodels.html
  http://mtv.com/            (also gopher)
  http://olt.et.tudelft.nl/  (also gopher)
  http://www.unipi.it/models.html   (under construction?)
  gopher://gopher.unipi.it/1
  gopher://louie.udel.edu/11/ftp/supermodels

    FTP-via-EMail servers take mailed commands, ftp for the
      requested file, and mail it back to you.
  mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with no subject line, and two-line body
      with line one help and line 2 quit
  mail bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu (body: help or ftplist for a list of
      anonymous ftp sites)

    Ken Higginson <khiggins@nyx.cs.du.edu>, and Pete "Ender" Walsh
    <ender@uunet.uu.net> have been compiling and posting lists of
    pictures of specific supermodels and where to get them.  Ender
    posts his Kathy Ireland list occasionally, and will not respond to
    mail asking for it.  I'm not sure about Ken.  Neither of them will
    send you pictures by mail, even if you ask very nicely.  They're
    just too burned out from all the previous requests.


#####################
Standard for posting pictures.
    Again, read Jim Howard's FAQ for alt.binaries.pictures.d  He clearly
    describes the current standards for splitting articles (and why you
    should), how to title them, helpful programs, etc.  In particular,
    look for xmitBin, an automated splitting-posting program.

    Pictures should be posted to alt.binaries.pictures.supermodels,
    not alt.supermodels.  Many sites do not get abps because
    of "moralistic" censorship, worries over copyright suites,
    low disk space, or low net bandwidth.  However, if pictures
    are posted to alt.supermodels, then it will also become blocked.

    [ Note to any admins reading this: Please don't cut off entire
    groups to save bandwidth/space, instead ask your feeder to place an
    article size limit on your feed.  That will accomplish your goal,
    but not subject you to irrate users screaming "censorship".  It
    will also protect you from idiots posting 5 Meg bible quotes to
    normal discussion groups (which actually happened about a year
    ago). ]

    If you can't access abps at your site, use an NNTP news reader
    to read from one of the public sites, use gopher, or find someone
    to mail you the pics.

    Auto-decoders (such as Mark Stantz's "aub") are becoming far more
    common.  These programs scan all new articles in a list of
    newsgroups, find the picture pieces, sort them, assemble them,
    process them, and drop the finished picture files in a directory.
    The only problem is they demand that the subject lines follow the
    standard.  If you don't follow the standard, a lot of people will
    never even see your posting; so why did you bother to post?

    Very few things are farther from the standard than NeXT's
    NewsGrazer format.  Only a tiny fraction of one percent of readers
    will be able to view it, so you're just wasting bandwidth.

Where to get the latest version of this and other FAQs.

History and purpose of alt.supermodels and this FAQ.
    alt.supermodels was created (at louie anyway) on 30 July 92, by a
    newgroup control message from umalexa9@ccu.umanitoba.ca (Edward W.
    Alexander).  The original purpose was discussion of supermodels.
    Then someone realized that supermodels are known through their
    pictures, so it is appropriate to discuss photographs here.  That
    led to posting pictures, so everyone could be talking about the same
    thing.  The end result seems to be flame wars.

|From: brinkley@cs.utexas.edu (Paul Brinkley)
|Subject: Re: Where are all the gifs
|Date: Mon Mar 01 11:56:16 EST 1993
|
|We just got through a pretty long and hard discussion concerning this.
|Apparently alt.supermodels was NOT created with massive picture-posting
|in mind.  Your post could possibly touch off another flame war.
|
|There are many alternatives to posting here.  First of all, unlike "erotic"
|GIFs, the NSF doesn't lean on any FTP sites under its influence for carrying
|pictures of models.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that due to the
|lesser demand for model pictures, posting a site's name will NOT cause its
|subsequent death from overload.  (I could be wrong on this.)
|
|For those who don't have FTP access, you could post to alt.binaries.pictures.-
|misc.  This is the perfect place for them; a.p.b.e is slightly less
|appropriate.  For those who have neither FTP nor access to the binaries
|groups, a simple e-mail should be adequate.  (And if you can't even get e-mail,
|you probably can't read this, either!)

|Subject: Who is NOT a supermodel.
|Date: 20 Jul 1993 03:19:06 GMT
|Summary: This group is not alt.fan.bimbo.chick
|
|Some people should look at the name of this group before posting. It is
|near impossible to create an algorithm that will separate people (mostly
|women) into two cases, supermodel and not-supermodel, and have it work
|perfectly. We can state, with total certainty, that some people are NOT
|supermodels.
|
|Tanya Roberts is NOT a supermodel.
|Dana Plato is NOT a supermodel.
|Some-chick-who-had-a-role-in-a-movie is NOT a supermodel.
|The Double Mint gum blow-job bimbo is NOT a supermodel.
|The Bud girls are NOT supermodels.
|
|This newsgroup is not alt.fan.chick.hot. Yes, it is unmoderated and there
|is no authority who can maintain topicality. Still, I ask for a bit of
|common sense and courtesy. Respect the bounds of this group.
|
|This group was created to discuss (mostly) women who have excelled in a
|particular career, modelling. This means a focus on the medium of
|photography. This means an association with the fashion industry. This
|means runway work.
|
|There is no reason to stifle all discussion, or to not engage in conversation
|about people who may not quite fit the supermodel category. Anna Nicole
|Smith is one such case. Personally, I don't care for the discussion about
|various TV commercial bimbos. They aren't supermodels and probably never
|will be. This falls, however remotely, within the framework of this group.
|Questions about, and GIF requests for, second-rate actresses does not.

|Okay everyone, back to REAL PURPOSE of alt.supermodels.
|magazine watching and model gossip.

    [ I (scott@ee.udel.edu, your occational FAQ maintainer) felt many
    inappropriate topics (ie. Janet vs. Chrissy debates) were
    swamping alt.supermodels.  I didn't want to ask people not to talk
    about them here, because I didn't feel there was an appropriate
    place where those discussions could be redirected.  I proposed
    creating alt.celebrities to handle the minor actresses, singers,
    playmates, etc.  I posted a series of RFDs and CFVs, and took
    votes.  The net vote was 80% in favor, so I newgrouped
    alt.celebrities.  I suggest that discussions of non-supermodels
    please be moved there. ]

    If you have to pay for connect time on your newsfeed, you may want
    to ask your feeder to place an article size limit on your feed.  The
    INN news transport system has this option.  A 40k limit will block
    most picture segments, and pass most discussion.  It's not a
    perfect solution, but it might save you some money.
