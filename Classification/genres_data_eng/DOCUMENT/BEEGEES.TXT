     the name "Rattlesnakes". They are going to lip-sing to an
     old record, but the record breaks (in those days the
     records broke!) so Robin suggests they shall go on stage
     and sing for real, and they do that. Changed for a short
     while name to "Wee Johnny Hayes and the bluecats" because
     they gets some new blue pants and wants to call
     themselves something with "the bluecats".
