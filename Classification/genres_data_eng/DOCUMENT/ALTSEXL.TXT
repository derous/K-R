	SF and Fantasy Alternate Sexuality Listing
	------------------------------------------

(All comments and critique welcome. I'd appreciate any comments on the books
listed here, any additional books by these authors, regardless of
sexual content, and anything you may have forgotten or assumed
~somebody else would recommend :-).  In addition, I'm also looking for
more non-positive renditions of alternate sexuality in fantasy...feel
free to send me SF too and I'll add it to the list even though I may
not use it for my paper.  I don't have time to read all of these, so
I'm relying on your comments.  Not everything listed here may be sf/f.

Many, many thanks...I'm sorry I can't thank you all personally.  I'll
keep posting updated lists every couple of weeks.)
