I understood your question. I just did not want to spend time writing a better explanation; I often do spend a lot of time answering questions. Fortunately you appreciate the help you got from Scott. I have seen this question asked before; did you try to search for previous answers? Did you search for articles and samples about static member functions and about using overlapped IO? I really do believe that the answer to this question would be clear if you were familiar with the fact that static member functions are called without a "this" pointer so that is why I suggested learning about C++. My hope was that my short answer was enough to help you search and find other answers and articles.
