     *********************************************************************

     fasa dates have been ignored, except in the cases where they have been
     incorporated into the novels and do not conflict.  all comic books
     have also been avoided since i personally doubt their accuracy, do not
     collect them, and am still recovering from the 1st generation of star
     trek comic books from way back when.  many novels and short stories
     are included however, though it is very doubtful that they all occur
     in the same star trek timeline.  note that primarily only past
     references of the novels and short stories are in the timeline. this
     is because the majority of novels occur during the latter half of the
     5-year mission (c. 2263-2265), and accurately piecing together the
     exact order of novels and short stories is a near-impossible jigsaw
     puzzle, especially where they contradict one another. only specific
     novels with relevent date references have been included, primarily
     those that occur between star trek-the motion picture and star trek
     ii: the wrath of khan.

                             the five-year mission
     the dates during which the famous 5 year mission occurs have been
     obtained from numerous sources. the original star trek time line was
     written by chuck graham and published in the fanzine menagerie v, c.









                             star trek chronology



     1974.  it was a mere two pages long with less than 3 dozen dates up to
     the start of the mission (2260 a.d.), but it was reprinted in geoffrey
     mandel's starfleet handbook and apparently made its way around in
     fandom.  the star fleet medical reference manual went by these dates
     and all other publications and blueprints followed suite.  around
     1980, a poorly researched book came out called star trek space flight
     chronology which totally blew away all previously established
     dates...


     how was 2260 a.d. established for the start of the 5-year mission?
     it's quite obvious that star trek is set in the 23rd century, this is
     an automatic "given" from sources such as the making of star trek.
     the question then arose as to exaactly when in this century.

     star trek's second pilot, "where no man has gone before" had the
     "enterprise" recover the recorder-marker of an earth ship at the edge
     of the galaxy, the s.s. "valiant."  it was mentioned repeatedly that
     the valiant had been lost 200 years ago.  for an earth vessel to
     travel that far it had to have had warp drive (despite kirk's comment
     about the inferior impulse engines of the "valiant").  warp drive was
     developed by earth in the 21st century as we later would meet the
     inventor, zefram cochrane in "metamorphosis" who disappeared "150
     years ago" by mccoy's reckoning.  he was an old man at the time, in
     cochrane's own words, before the companion rejuvenated him.
     furthermore, he went on to identify mr. spock as a vulcan
     (questionably), but had never heard of the united federation of
     planets.  these facts alone place "where no man has gone before" no
     sooner than the mid-23rd century.

     in the first season episode "miri", the "enterprise" encounters a
     duplicate earth where, we assume, history ran parallel to that on the
     real earth.  shortly after beamdown, spock comments that it is earth
     circa 1960.  later on in the episode, kirk and spock come across an
     ancient piano.  kirk asks mr. spock its age and spock replies with the
     figure of 300 years.  1960 + 300 = 2260 a.d.

     "space seed", the episode by which space flight chronology, and later
     fasa, falsly place star trek around the early 23rd century, must be
     ignored.  if we examine this episode closely from the start, kirk was
     confused by the age of the s.s. "botany bay".  when first spotted,
     kirk mistakenly refers to it as a dy-500 series ship and spock
     corrects him "much older, dy-100 series".  after khan's revival kirk
     tells him he was sleeping for "two centuries we estimate".  the dy-100
     series was an interplanetary ship, according to spock, last produced
     and launched in the late 20th century.  obviously the dy-500 came much
     later (mid- or late-21st century).  kirk absent-mindedly told khan the
     two centuries after the dy-500 series (c. 2050 + 200 = 2250).
     likewise, the date mentioned in "squire of gothos" must also be
     ignored (placing star trek centuries later in time).

     the animated series which followed went on to support the 2260 star
     trek date.  "the terratin incident" dealt with a lost earth colony









                             star trek chronology



     stranded on the planet cepheus.  at the beginning of the episode,
     uhura picks up a message in interstat code, commenting that inerstat's
     been out of use for two centuries.  we later learn that the colony had
     transporters, which mr. spock was not surprised to learn for an early
     earth colony.  the colony was originally named terra 10 and we assume
     that there were at least 9 other interstellar earth colonies
     attempted.  this suggests that transporter technology was developed in
     the 21st century, probably shortly after warp drive.  the episode "the
     slaver weapon" introduced us to the kzinti (borrowed from larry
     niven's known space books).  we learn from mr. sulu that the kzinti
     fought 4 wars with mankind and lost all of them--the last one being
     200 years ago.  indeed, star trek cannot take place any earlier than
     2260.  in order to defeat the kzinti, earth had to have had space
     flight and warp driven ships.  quite possibly the development of warp
     drive and transporter technology shortly thereafter enabled earth to
     conquer the kzinti.

     the novels which shortly followed supported this dating system.  the
     dates mentioned in "world without end" place star trek sometime in the
     mid-23rd century and the novel "perry's planet" is set around an earth
     colony launched about 300 years ago (a bit on the high side).

     thus, the voyages of the "enterprise" under kirk's command occured
     from 2260-2265 a.d.  other novels and references "fine-tuned" this a
     bit.  "enterprise: the first adventure" tells us that kirk took
     command of the "enterprise" even earlier, 2258, based upon his age.
     furthermore, it would have taken time for kirk to familiarize himself
     with the ship before taking on any major missions.  shortly after
     "enterprise" occurs the novel "strangers from the sky (book ii)", and
     then on to "where no man has gone before" (late 2259).  this last
     episode takes up the bulk of time between 2258 and 2260:  the two-way
     trip from u.f.p. space to the energy barrier at the edge of our
     galaxy.  early 2260 is also spent uprating the "enterprise"
     ("constitution" class to the specs of the "bonhomme richard"
     class--but that's another file in itself!) and of course the
     installation of new systems and the institution of new uniforms
     ("corbomite maneuver" onwards).  the 5 year mission therefore
     "officially" begins right after the "enterprise" returns and is
     refitted following the second pilot episode, in early 2260.  (kirk's
     prologue explaining "its five year mission..." isn't even incorporated
     into the title sequence of the 2nd pilot episode!)

     now if the order of the original episodes are examined, you will
     notice them to be in production order.  considering the minute changes
     of systems (and uniforms worn) aboard the enterprise, there is simply
     no other logical way to chronical the episodes.  aired order begins
     with "the man trap", when clearly the first episode is "where no man
     has gone before".  taking them in stardate order is an intriguing
     idea, but stardates do not hold up when the additional stardates of
     the animated series and the novels are incorporated.  novels make
     things worse.  in fact, stardates actually overlap in certain episodes
     ("corbomite maneuver" and "the man trap").  in addition, many
     novelists don't take stardates seriously.  we have to live with the









                             star trek chronology



     information in the making of star trek that stardates have no real
     chronological bearing for the enterprise.

     examining the chronology you will see that the first season episodes
     span the first two years, 2260 and 2261 and the second and third
     season epsides are in 2262 and 2263 respectively.  why?  "charlie x"
     is set in november as kirk mentions thanksgiving--the latter half of
     the year.  the episodes "court-martial" and "the menagerie" were
     filmed one after another yet both take place at the same starbase 11
     (despite asherman's numerical errors in his star trek compendium).  we
     first see the base being commanded by commodore stone and then we see
     it commanded by commodore mendez.  obviously there is a considerable
     gap of time between these two episodes.  furthermore, in "day of the
     dove", kang states that the klingon empire and the federation have
     been at peace for 3 years, not 2 as we would believe (deliberately
     overlooking the possibility that he was referring to klingon years).

     immediately following the original episodes are the 22 animated
     episodes.  they are not in production order, aired order, or stardate
     order.  they follow in the order in which alan dean foster novelized
     them.  why?  a.d.f. has contributed more to the star trek universe
     than any other novelist in his star trek log series of ten books.
     they are linked together in his own unique order, with the last 4
     adaptations blown-up into full-length novels, greatly expanded and
     providing a rich source of information to fandom.  the klolode class
     ship name was taken from star trek log 4, the concept of transporter
     patterns being used for security purposes was taken from star trek log
     3, and the rich background of the characters arex and m'ress were
     drawn from these novelizations.  each of which was far more faithful
     to the original work than any of james blish's attempts.  "the
     survivor" is said to take place on christmas and thus is considered
     the last episode of 2263.  the bulk of the star trek novels follow the
     animated episodes in the remaining 2263 and 2264 years.  early 2265
     marks the end of the mission and "the lost years" follow immediately.
     two and a half years after, in 2267, "star trek-the motion picure"
     occurs.

                                  the movies
     undisputably, the films star trek ii: the wrath of khan, star trek
     iii: the search for spock, star trek iv: the voyage home, and star
     trek v: the final frontier all occur one after another with very short
     timelapses between one another.  in fact, the above four films occured
     within one to two year's time, no longer.  many months being the crews
     exile on vulcan between st iii and st iv, and the alteration of bridge
     and systems of ncc-1701-a between st iv and st v.

     this leaves us with the gap of time between star trek-the motion
     picture and star trek ii: the wrath of khan.  from the statements of
     kirk and khan we are led to believe that "space seed" happened 15
     years ago.  there is therefore a gap of 7-8 years between st-tmp and
     st ii.  unfortunately this does not hold up under intense analysis.
     there is overwhelming data to suggest that "space seed" occured
     further back than just 15 years.









                             star trek chronology




     1.  in st ii, kirk reads the date 2283 off of the romulan ale bottle.
     mccoy replies that it needs to age.  assuming it is an earth date and
     not a romulan date (fasa fans prefer the latter) then the timeline is
     off by 8+ years, as it brings us to 2275.
     2.  in st iii, admiral morrow states that the "enterprise" is 20 years
     old.  what comes as a shock to the officers is star fleet's idea of
     decommissioning the "enterprise."  although externally scarred from
     battling the "reliant", the "enterprise" was still quite intact and
     repairable.  if there was only a 7-8 year gap between the time she was
     rebuilt and the time star fleet wants to decommission her, something
     is terribly wrong.  even more troubling is the 20 years statement,
     when it should be more like 55 years.  the "enterprise" is the pride
     of the fleet, the finest starship and according to unanimous tech
     sources, has a duration of 22 years.
     3.  in st v, the planet of galactic peace was established between the
     klingons, romulans, and federation.  if "space seed" (a 1st season
     episode) was really 15 years ago, then it occured the same year as
     "balance of terror": the federation's only contact with the romulans
     in a century's time.  in other words, nimbus iii was settled 5 years
     before "balance of terror" which is impossible. it's also quite
     unlikely that the war-mongering romulans would sit down with the
     federation and agree to jointly settle a planet.

     what is the solution to all these discontinuties?  if admiral morrow
     was referring to the age of the uprated "enterprise" of st-tmp, then
     most of these problems are solved.  2267 + 20 = 2287.  the date comes
     reasonably close to her maximum duration deadline (22 years).  the
     date also surpasses the 2283 date on the ale bottle, well within the
     "need to age range" (4 year old ale).  it's also a reasonable amount
     of time after "balance of terror" for the romulans to reaquaint
     themselves with the u.f.p.  furthermore, the actors would be
     portraying characters much closer to their actual ages. otherwise,
     shatner, nimoy, and kelly would have been portraying characters 10+
     years younger than themselves in st v!  the only glitch in this
     approach is the 15 year statements in st ii.  some were made by khan:
     perhaps a ceti alphan year is longer than an earth year?  either way
     he still clung to 200 years from 1996, "on earth--200 years ago--i was
     a prince..."  he was clearly confused about time passage.  fasa fans
     and friends of shane johnson's books who dispute this and point to the
     service pins on the uniforms as a "proof" of a 7-8 year gap will be
     sad to know that the pins don't hold water under close analysis, since
      kirk should have at least one more 5 year pin and possibly 2 of them
     (kirk was at the academy 15 years before "space seed" according to
     "shore leave").  there are even more problems if anyone's analyzed the
     service pins on spock, mccoy, scotty, uhura, sulu, and chekov.

                              the next generation
     how well does the timeline hold up when next generation dates and
     references are taken into account?  very well, but there are
     anomalies.

     in "encounter at farpoint", data states mccoy's age at being 137.









                             star trek chronology



     this places the first season of the next generation in the year 2355.
     towards the end of the first season, data gives us the year as being
     2364.  finally something undisputable to work with!  there is a +9
     year discrepancy.  in the 3rd season, we are told by data in
     "evolution" that the last shipwide computer failure in a star fleet
     starship was 79 years ago.  2364 + 3 (3rd season/year) = 2366.  2366 -
     79 = 2287!  2287, the year of our last 4 trek movies, the year of
     ncc-1701-a's launch and it's flop in st v due to a shipwide computer
     failure.  there is little doubt why data was given this line in
     "evolution" and it's highly unlikely for it to be mere coincidence.
     right on the nose.  in "sarek", picard tells his bridge officers that
     sarek is 202 years old.  in "journey to babel" sarek stated his age at
     being 102.437--about 100 years between the two episodes.  using my
     timeline, taking "journey to babel" as being in 2262 and "sarek" as
     being 2366, there's a +4 year discrepancy.  one possible means of
     explaining away the problem of age is time dilation: the slowing down
     of time aboard ships approaching light speed in real space.  over a
     great period of time, this can add up.  consider the possibility that
     a being of star trek's time may have a biological age (the subjective
     age of the being's body) and a chronological age (the being's
     objective age computed from birthdate and present date).  in the novel
     "enterprise: the first adventure", it is stated that yeoman rand had
     experienced this firsthand and used it to her advantage.  with all the
     time mccoy and sarek spent in space, a few years would add up.

     it's quite apparent where the star trek script writers got their dates
     from.  they went by the original series dates (1966-1969) and added
     300 years on.  the 2364 of the next generation was probably chosen
     because it is a century after "the cage", trek's first produced
     episode (1964).  when st ii was filmed, it was nearly 15 years after
     1966's "space seed".  by the time st iii came out, the "enterprise"
     (the original model, that is!) was around 20 years old.  the same
     figure of 20 years was used to place the time of the planet of
     galactic peace.  the ages of mccoy and sarek were only roughly
     estimated by the writers based upon these factors, and in either case
     failed to take into account minute changes, such as "sarek" being a
     third season episode.  the year 2287 of st v was appropriately chosen
     because it is nearly contemporary and nearly the year of st v's
     release, minus three centuries.

     in closing, let me add that i am not responsible for creating this
     chronology.  these dates are compiled from numerous sources, spanning
     over 15 years, from star trek "tech fandom" which has been responsible
     for much of the detailed technical background of the star trek
     universe.  the material from the novels was simply integrated in based
     upon references given.  as for the chronology itself, here's a rough
     look at my sources, a bibliography:

     the starfleet handbook (1975):  chuck graham's 2-page star trek
     timeline which set the trend for future trek historians.  not very
     accurate for certain dates, but overall forming the layout of trek
     history.










                             star trek chronology



     star fleet medical reference manual:  featuring an impressive medical
     timeline of dates and a detailed listing of elements and their dates
     and places of discovery.

     u.s.s. enterprise officer's manual:  the first book to accurately nail
     down the starting and ending dates of the 5 year mission.  the manual
     is also a treasure chest of birthdates and service records of the
     enterprise officers, and also the launch date of the constitution
     class heavy cruiser (c. 2217), nicely jiving with the material in the
     making of star trek and star trek log 7.  there is also rich
     background about how (larry niven's) kzinti and (james blish's) vegans
     fit into star trek.  as a side note, a revised u.s.s. enterprise
     officer's manual was later published--drastically changed with dates
     altered to fit into the faulty fasa roleplaying/spaceflight chronology
     universe.  much was removed and some pages were added, with
     considerable contributions from shane johnson, a die-hard fasa
     supporter who has his own conflicting tech drawings.  the revised
     manual should be ignored date-wise.

     star trek maps:  once again adding to what went before it, this
     beautiful package features the u.f.p. mapped out in 4 colorful maps
     based upon actual star charts packed with details.  the 29 u.f.p.
     worlds admission dates into the federation are given here along with
     the founding/contact dates in an introduction to navigation manual,
     which also provides insight into the chronological development of warp
     drive.

     u.s.s. avenger class blueprints:  mostly background information and
     dates about how the "reliant" of st ii evolved in an excellent set of
     blueprints.

     starship design:  a 23rd century naval publication showing numerous
     ships and their background.

     line officer requirements:  a 3-volume set (volumes i & ii plus a
     supplement).  the least impressive of all manuals, artwork wise, but
     easily surpassing fasa works in workmanship and research (if
     overlooking numerous typographical errors).  numerous historical dates
     are given.

     federation reference series:  6 issues forming an updated tech manual
     which includes the best guide to star fleet uniforms ever.  the actual
     launch dates of classic star fleet ship classes are given along with
     their status codes (based upon the subquadrant info in star trek
     maps).  dates of uniform issuing, the klingon war etc.  the first
     manual to go by the 20 year gap (sttmp/st ii) assumption.

     u.s.s. ingram/excelsior blueprints:  nice prints of the upgraded
     u.s.s. "excelsior."  acknowledges the 20 year gap (as does all
     publications from here on) and supplies dates concerning the transwarp
     development and the date of the most recent films (2287).

     u.s.s. enterprise heavy cruiser evolution blueprints:  3 giant sheets









                             star trek chronology



     packed with info, expanding upon federation reference series, giving
     the launch and commissioning dates of heavy cruisers and how the
     u.s.s. "enterprise" was uprated over the decades to match the latest
     heavy cruiser specs.

     ships of the fleet (vol. i):  an expansion of heavy cruiser evolution
     blueprints but with emphasis upon their current status.  not only
     featuring heavy cruisers but also the belknap strike cruiser and rich
     backgrounds of each class.


     oh, one more thing... this star trek chronology is copyright 1990 by
     'james dixon'. it's not to be sold or altered in any way but you're
     free to distribute it around all you'd like...  in fact, i'm hoping
     that you do.  leave the altering to me.  i'm sure that by the time you
     read this file my original will be greatly expanded.  this originally
     started off as a hobby for my own private use and i had no intention
     of uploading it.  now it's grown beyond that.

     special thanks go to lyndon brunel for technical support and
     additional research and, of course, my deepest thanks to those who've
     contributed to and expanded upon "tech fandom"...
