                             PROLOGUE                          
                             
   
       Hear me! We've heard of Danish heroes, 
       
   ancient kings and the glory they cut 
   
   for themselves, swinging mighty swords! 
   
       
       How Shild made slaves of soldiers from every 
       
   land, crowds of captives he'd beaten                            5                    
   
   into terror; he'd  travelled to Denmark alone, 
   
   an abandoned child, but changed his own fate, 
   
   lived to be rich and much honored. He ruled 
   
   lands on all sides: wherever the sea 
   
   would take them his soldiers sailed, returned                   10
   
   with tribute and obedience. There was a brave 
   
   King! And he gave them more than  his glory, 
   
   conceived a son for the Danes, a new leader 
   
   allowed them by the  grace of the God. They had lived, 
   
   before his coming, kingless and miserable;                      15 
   
   now the Lord of all life, Ruler 
   
   of glory, blessed them with a prince, Beo, 
   
   whose power and fame soon spread through the world. 
   
   Shild's strong son was the glory of Denmark; 
   
   his father's warriors were wound round his heart                20
   
   with golden rings, bound to their prince 
   
   by his father's treasure. So young man build 
   
   the future, wisely  open-handed in peace, 
   
   protected in war; so warriors earn 
   
   their fame, and wealth is shaped with a sword.                  25
   
   
       When his time was come the old king died, 
       
   still strong but called to the Lord's hands. 
   
   His comrades carried him down to the shore, 
   
   bore him as their leader had asked, their lord 
   
   and companion, while words could move on his tongue.            30  
   
   Shild's reign had been long; he'd ruled them well. 
   
   There in the harbor was a ring-prowed fighting 
   
   ship, its timbers icy, waiting, 
   
   and there they brought the beloved body 
   
   of their ring-giving lord, and laid him near                    35 
   
   the mast. Next to that noble corpse 
   
   they heaped up treasures, jeweled helmets, 
   
   hooked swords and coats of mail, armor 
   
   carried from the ends of the earth: no ship 
   
   had ever sailed so brightly fitted,                             40
   
   no king sent forth more deeply mourned. 
   
   Forced to set him adrift, floating 
   
   as far as the tide mught run, they refused 
   
   to give him less from their hoards of gold 
   
   than those who'd shipped him away, an orphan                    45
   
   and a beggar, to cross the waves alone. 
   
   High up over his head they flew 
   
   his shining banner, then sadly let 
   
   the water pull at the ship, watched it 
   
   slowly sliding to where neither rulers                          50
   
   nor heroes nor anyone can say whose hands 
   
   opened to take that motionless cargo.
   
   
   
   
   
   
             1
   
             
       
       Then Beo was king in that Danish castle,
       
   Shild's son ruling as long as his father
   
   and as loved, a famous lord of men.                             55
   
   And he in turn gave people a son,
   
   the great Healfdane, a fierce fighter
   
   who led the Danes to the end of his long
   
   life and left them four children,
   
   three princes to guide them in battle, Hergar                   60
   
   and Hrothgar and Halga the Good, and one daughter,
   
   Yrs, who was given to Onela, king
   
   of the Swedes, and became his wife and their queen.
   
      Then Hrothgar, taking the throne, led
      
   the Danes to such glory that comrades and kinsmen               65
   
   swore by his sword, and young men swelled
   
   his armies, and he thought of greatness and resolved
   
   to build a hall that would hold his mighty
   
   band and reach higher toward Heaven than anything
   
   that had ever been known to the sons of men.                    70
   
   And in that hall he'd divide the spoils
   
   of their victories, to old and young what they'd earned
   
   in battle, but leaving the common pastures
   
   untouched, and taking no lives. The work
   
   was odered, the timbers tied and shaped                         75    
   
   by the hosts that Hrothgar ruled. It was quickly
   
   ready, that most beautiful of dwellings, built
   
   as he'd wanted, and then he whose word was obeyed
   
   all over the earth named it Herot.
   
   His boast come true he commanded a banquet,                     80
   
   opened out his treasure-full hands.
   
   That towering place, gabled and huge,
   
   stood waiting for time to pass, for war
   
   to begin, for flames to leap as high
   
   as the feud that would light them, and for Herot to burn.       85
   
       A powerful monster, living down
       
   in the darkness, growled in pain, impatient
   
   as day after day the music rang
   
   loud in that hall, the harp's rejoicing
   
   call and the poet's clear song, sung                            90      
   
   of the ancient beginnings of us all, recalling
   
   the Almighty making the earth, shaping
   
   these beautiful plains marked off by oceans,
   
   then proudly setting the sun and moon
   
   to glow across the land and light it;                           95   
   
   the corners of the earth were made lovely with trees
   
   and leaves, made quick with life, with each
   
   of the nations who now move on its face. And then
   
   as now warriors sang of their pleasure:
   
   so Hrothgar's men lived happy in his hall                       100 
   
   till the monster stirred, that demon, that fiend,
   
   Grendel, who haunted the moors, the wild
   
   marshes, and made his home in a hell
   
   not hell but earth. He was sprawned with slime,
   
   conceived by a pair of those monsters born                      105 
   
   of Cain, murderous creatures banished
   
   by God, punished forever for the crime
   
   of Abel's death. The Almighty drove
   
   those demons out, and their exile was bitter,
   
   shut away from men: they split                                  110
   
   into a thousand forms of evel - spirits
   
   and fiends, goblins, monsters, giants,
   
   a brood forever opposing the Lord's
   
   will, and again and again defeated.
   
   
   
   
           2
           
           
   
       Then, when darkness had dropped, Grendel                    115
   
   went up to Herot, wondering what the warriors
   
   would do in that hall when their drinking was done.
   
   He found them sprawled in sleep, suspecting 
   
   nothing, their dreams undisturbed. The monster's
   
   thoughts were as quick as his greed or his claws:               120
   
   he slipped through the door and there in silence
   
   snatched up thirty men, smashed them
   
   unknowing in their beds and ran out with their bodies,
   
   the blood dripping behind him, back
   
   to his lair, delighted with his night's slaughter.              125
   
       At daybreak, with the sun's first light, they saw
       
   how well he had worked, and in that gray morning
   
   broke their long feast with tears and laments
   
   for the dead. Hrothgar, their lord, sat joyless
   
   in Herot, a mighty prince mourning                              130 
   
   the fate of his lost friends and companions,
   
   knowing by its tracks that some demon had torn
   
   his followers apart. He wept, fearing
   
   the beginning might not be the end. And that night
   
   Grendel come again, so set                                      135
   
   on murder that no crime could ever be enough,
   
   no savage assault quench his lust
   
   for evil. Then each warrior tried
   
   to escape him, searched for rest in different
   
   beds, as far from Herot as they could find,                     140   
   
   seeing how Grendel hunted when they slept.
   
   Distance was safety; the only survivors
   
   were those who fled him. Hate had triumphed.
   
       So Grendel ruled, fought with the righteous,
       
   one against many, and won; so Herot                             145
   
   stood empty, and stayed deserted for years,
   
   twelve winters of grief for Hrothgar, king
   
   of the Danes, sorrow heaped at his door
   
   by hell-forged hands. His misery leaped
   
   the seas, was told and sung in all                              150
   
   men's ears: how Grendel's hatred began,
   
   how the monster relished his savage war
   
   on the Danes, keeping bloody feud
   
   alive, seeking no peace, offering
   
   no truce, accepting no settlement, no price                     155
   
   in gold or land, and paying the living
   
   for one crime only with another. No one
   
   waited for reparation from his plundering claws:
   
   that shadow of death hunted in the darkness,
   
   stalked Hrothgar's warriors, old                                160
   
   and young, lying in waiting, hidden
   
   in mist, invisibly following them from the edge
   
   of the marsh, always there, unseen.
   
       So mankind's enemy continued his crimes,
   
   killing as often as he could, coming                            165
   
   alone, bloodthirsty and horrible. Though he lived
   
   in Herot, when the night hid him, he never
   
   dared to touch king Hrothgar's glorious
   
   throne, protected by the God - God,
   
   whose love Grendel could not know. But Hrothgar's               170
   
   heart was bent. The best and most noble
   
   of his council debated remedies, sat
   
   in secret sessions, talking of terror
   
   and wondering what the bravest of warriors could do.
   
   And sometime they sacrificed to the old stone gods,             175  
   
   made heathen vows, hoping for Hell's
   
   support, the Devil's guidance in driving
   
   their affliction off. That was their way,
   
   and the heathen's only hope, Hell
   
   always in their hearts, knowing neither God                     180
   
   nor His passing as He walks through our world, the Lord         
   
   of Heaven and earth; their ears could not hear
   
   His prase nor know His glory. Let them
   
   beware, those who are thrust into danger,
   
   clutched at by trouble, yet can carry no solace                 185
   
   in their hearts, cannot hope to be better! Hail
   
   to those who will rise to God, drop off
   
   their dead bodies and seek our Father's peace!
