       TIMELINE III

Here is the third version of the Timeline of Amber -- I update it and post
every time a new book comes out (or at least, that is what seems to be
happening).  As always, comments are appreciated.

PS. Many dates on the timeline come from inference and calculation.  Some
are approximate.

PPS. One of my favorite UNIX commands is "grep Brand amber.timeline".
(This lists all lines containing the word "Brand").  Invent your own.
