     John Lincoln (a broker), Doll, Betts, (Sherwin
     (a goldsmith),) and prentices armed; (Thomas More
     (sheriff of the City of  London), the other sheriff,
     Sir Thomas Palmer, Sir Roger Cholmeley, and a serjeant-at-arms
     stand aloof )

    LINCOLN
     (to the prentices)
     Peace, hear me! He that will
     not see a red herring at a Harry groat, butter at eleven
     pence a pound, meal at nine shillings a bushel, and
     beef at four nobles a stone, list to me.

    OTHER
     It will come to that pass if strangers be suffered.
     Mark him.

    LINCOLN
     Our country is a great eating country; argo,
     they eat more in our country than they do in their
     own.

    OTHER
     By a halfpenny loaf a day, troy weight.

    LINCOLN
     They bring in strange roots, which is merely to
     the undoing of poor prentices, for what's a sorry parsnip
     to a good heart?

    OTHER
     Trash, trash. They breed sore eyes, and 'tis enough
     to infect the city with the palsy.

    LINCOLN
     Nay, it has infected it with the palsy, for these
     bastards of dung - as you know, they grow in dung -
     have infected us, and it is our infection will make the
     city shake, which partly comes through the eating of
     parsnips.

    OTHER
     True, and pumpions together.

    SERJEANT
     (coming forward)
     What say you to the mercy of the King?
     Do you refuse it?

    LINCOLN
     You would have us upon th' hip, would you?
     No, marry, do we not. We accept of the King's mercy;
     but we will show no mercy upon the strangers.

    SERJEANT
     You are the simplest things
     That ever stood in such a question.

    LINCOLN
     How say you now? Prentices 'simple'?
     (To the prentices) Down with him!

    ALL
     Prentices simple! Prentices simple!
     Enter the Lord Mayor, the Earl of Surrey, and the
     Earl of Shrewsbury

    (SHERIFF)
     (to the prentices)
     Hold in the King's name! Hold!

    SURREY
     (to the prentices)
     Friends, masters, countrymen -

    MAYOR
     (to the prentices)
     Peace ho, peace! I charge you, keep the peace!

    SHREWSBURY
     (to the prentices)
     My masters, countrymen -

    (SHERWIN)
     The noble Earl of Shrewsbury, let's hear him.

    BETTS
     We'll hear the Earl of Surrey.

    LINCOLN
     The Earl of Shrewsbury.

    BETTS
     We'll hear both.

    ALL
     Both, both, both, both!

    LINCOLN
     Peace, I say peace! Are you men of wisdom, or
     what are you?

    SURREY
     What you will have them, but not men of wisdom.

    (SOME)
     We'll not hear my Lord of Surrey.

    (OTHERS)
     No, no, no, no, no! Shrewsbury, Shrewsbury!

    MORE
     (to the nobles and officers)
     Whiles they are o'er the bank of their obedience,
     Thus will they bear down all things.

    LINCOLN
     (to the prentices)
     Sheriff More speaks. Shall we hear Sheriff More speak?

    DOLL
     Let's hear him. A keeps a plentiful shrievaltry, and
     a made my brother Arthur Watchins Sergeant Safe's
     yeoman. Let's hear Sheriff More.

    ALL
     Sheriff More, More, More, Sheriff More!

    MORE
     Even by the rule you have among yourselves,
     Command still audience.

    SOME
     Surrey, Surrey!

    OTHERS
     More, More!

    LINCOLN AND BETTS
     Peace, peace, silence, peace!

    MORE
     You that have voice and credit with the number,
     Command them to a stillness.

    LINCOLN
     A plague on them! They will not hold their
     peace. The devil cannot rule them.

    MORE
     Then what a rough and riotous charge have you,
     To lead those that the devil cannot rule.
     (To the prentices) Good masters, hear me speak.

    DOLL
     Ay, by th' mass, will we. More, thou'rt a good
     housekeeper, and I thank thy good worship for my
     brother Arthur Watchins.

    ALL
     Peace, peace!

    MORE
     Look, what you do offend you cry upon,
     That is the peace. Not one of you here present,
     Had there such fellows lived when you were babes
     That could have topped the peace as now you would,
     The peace wherein you have till now grown up
     Had been ta'en from you, and the bloody times
     Could not have brought you to the state of men.
     Alas, poor things, what is it you have got,
     Although we grant you get the thing you seek?

    BETTS
     Marry, the removing of the strangers, which cannot
     choose but much advantage the poor handicrafts of the
     city.

    MORE
     Grant them removed, and grant that this your noise
     Hath chid down all the majesty of England.
     Imagine that you see the wretched strangers,
     Their babies at their backs, with their poor luggage
     Plodding to th' ports and coasts for transportation,
     And that you sit as kings in your desires,
     Authority quite silenced by your brawl
     And you in ruff of your opinions clothed:
     What had you got? I'll tell you. You had taught
     How insolence and strong hand should prevail,
     How order should be quelled - and by this pattern
     Not one of you should live an agŠd man,
     For other ruffians as their fancies wrought
     With selfsame hand, self reasons, and self right
     Would shark on you, and men like ravenous fishes
     Would feed on one another.

    DOLL
     Before God, that's as true as the gospel.

    BETTS
     Nay, this' a sound fellow, I tell you. Let's mark
     him.

    MORE
     Let me set up before your thoughts, good friends,
     One supposition, which if you will mark
     You shall perceive how horrible a shape
     Your innovation bears. First, 'tis a sin
     Which oft th' apostle did forewarn us of,
     Urging obedience to authority;
     And 'twere no error if I told you all
     You were in arms 'gainst God.

    ALL
     Marry, God forbid that!

    MORE
     Nay, certainly you are.
     For to the King God hath his office lent
     Of dread, of justice, power and command,
     Hath bid him rule and willed you to obey;
     And to add ampler majesty to this,
     He hath not only lent the King his figure,
     His throne and sword, but given him his own name,
     Calls him a god on earth. What do you then,
     Rising 'gainst him that God himself installs,
     But rise 'gainst God? What do you to your souls
     In doing this? O desperate as you are,
     Wash your foul minds with tears, and those same hands
     That you like rebels lift against the peace
     Lift up for peace; and your unreverent knees,
     Make them your feet. To kneel to be forgiven
     Is safer wars than ever you can make,
     Whose discipline is riot.
     In, in, to your obedience! Why, even your hurly
     Cannot proceed but by obedience.
     What rebel captain,
     As mut'nies are incident, by his name
     Can still the rout? Who will obey a traitor?
     Or how can well that proclamation sound,
     When there is no addition but 'a rebel'
     To qualify a rebel? You'll put down strangers,
     Kill them, cut their throats, possess their houses,
     And lead the majesty of law in lyam
     To slip him like a hound - alas, alas!
     Say now the King,
     As he is clement if th' offender mourn,
     Should so much come too short of your great trespass
     As but to banish you: whither would you go?
     What country, by the nature of your error,
     Should give you harbour? Go you to France or Flanders,
     To any German province, Spain or Portugal,
     Nay, anywhere that not adheres to England -
     Why, you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased
     To find a nation of such barbarous temper
     That breaking out in hideous violence
     Would not afford you an abode on earth,
     Whet their detested knives against your throats,
     Spurn you like dogs, and like as if that God
     Owed not nor made not you, nor that the elements
     Were not all appropriate to your comforts
     But chartered unto them, what would you think
     To be thus used? This is the strangers' case,
     And this your mountainish inhumanity.

    (ONE)
     (to the others)
     Faith, a says true. Let's do as we may
     be done by.

    (ANOTHER)
     (to More)
     We'll be ruled by you, Master More,
     if you'll stand our friend to procure our pardon.

    MORE
     Submit you to these noble gentlemen,
     Entreat their mediation to the King,
     Give up yourself to form, obey the magistrate,
     And there's no doubt but mercy may be found,
     If you so seek it.

 2.0 Add.III

     Enter Sir Thomas More

    MORE
     It is in heaven that I am thus and thus,
     And that which we profanely term our fortunes
     Is the provision of the power above,
     Fitted and shaped just to that strength of nature
     Which we are born withal. Good God, good God,
     That I from such an humble bench of birth
     Should step as 'twere up to my country's head
     And give the law out there; ay, in my father's life
     To take prerogative and tithe of knees
     From elder kinsmen, and him bind by my place
     To give the smooth and dexter way to me
     That owe it him by nature! Sure these things,
     Not physicked by respect, might turn our blood
     To much corruption. But More, the more thou hast
     Either of honour, office, wealth and calling,
     Which might accite thee to embrace and hug them,
     The more do thou e'en serpents' natures think them:
     Fear their gay skins, with thought of their sharp stings,
     And let this be thy maxim: to be great
     Is, when the thread of hazard is once spun,
     A bottom great wound up, greatly undone.
