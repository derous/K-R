     Flourish. Enter Prologue

    PROLOGUE
     New plays and maidenheads are near akin:
     Much followed both, for both much money giv'n
     If they stand sound and well. And a good play,
     Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage day
     And shake to lose his honour, is like her
     That after holy tie and first night's stir
     Yet still is modesty, and still retains
     More of the maid to sight than husband's pains.
     We pray our play may be so, for I am sure
     It has a noble breeder and a pure,
     A learnäd, and a poet never went
     More famous yet 'twixt Po and silver Trent.
     Chaucer, of all admired, the story gives:
     There constant to eternity it lives.
     If we let fall the nobleness of this
     And the first sound this child hear be a hiss,
     How will it shake the bones of that good man,
     And make him cry from under ground, 'O fan
     From me the witless chaff of such a writer,
     That blasts my bays and my famed works makes lighter
     Than Robin Hood'? This is the fear we bring,
     For to say truth, it were an endless thing
     And too ambitious to aspire to him,
     Weak as we are, and almost breathless swim
     In this deep water. Do but you hold out
     Your helping hands and we shall tack about
     And something do to save us. You shall hear
     Scenes, though below his art, may yet appear
     Worth two hours' travail. To his bones, sweet sleep;
     Content to you. If this play do not keep
     A little dull time from us, we perceive
     Our losses fall so thick we must needs leave.
     Flourish. Exit

 1.1 Scene 1
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Music. Enter Hymen with a torch burning, a Boy
     in a white robe before, singing and strewing flowers.  After Hymen, a
     nymph encompassed in her tresses, bearing a wheaten garland.  Then
     Theseus between two other nymphs with wheaten chaplets on their heads.
     Then Hippolyta, the bride, led by Pirithous and another holding a
     garland over her head, her tresses likewise hanging.  After her, Emilia
     holding up her train.  Then Artesius (and other attendants)

    BOY
     (sings during procession)
            Roses, their sharp spines being gone,
            Not royal in their smells alone,
            But in their hue;
            Maiden pinks, of odour faint,
            Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,
            And sweet thyme true;
            Primrose, first-born child of Ver,
            Merry springtime's harbinger,
            With harebells dim;
            Oxlips, in their cradles growing,
            Marigolds, on deathbeds blowing,
            Lark's-heels trim;
            All dear nature's children sweet,
            Lie fore bride and bridegroom's feet,
     He strews flowers
            Blessing their sense.
            Not an angel of the air,
            Bird melodious, or bird fair,
            Is absent hence.
            The crow, the sland'rous cuckoo, nor
            The boding raven, nor chough hoar,
            Nor chatt'ring pie,
            May on our bridehouse perch or sing,
            Or with them any discord bring,
            But from it fly.
     Enter three Queens in black, with veils stained, with
     imperial crowns. The First Queen falls down at the foot
     of Theseus; the Second falls down at the foot of Hippolyta;
     the Third, before Emilia

    FIRST QUEEN
     (to Theseus)
     For pity's sake and true gentility's,
     Hear and respect me.

    SECOND QUEEN
     (to Hippolyta)
     For your mother's sake,
     And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair ones,
     Hear and respect me.

    THIRD QUEEN
     (to Emilia)
     Now for the love of him whom Jove hath marked
     The honour of your bed, and for the sake
     Of clear virginity, be advocate
     For us and our distresses. This good deed
     Shall raze you out o'th' Book of Trespasses
     All you are set down there.

    THESEUS
     (to First Queen)
     Sad lady, rise.

    HIPPOLYTA
     (to Second Queen)
     Stand up.

    EMILIA
     (to Third Queen)
     No knees to me.What woman I may stead that is distressed
     Does bind me to her.

    THESEUS
     (to First Queen)
     What's your request? Deliver you for all.

    FIRST QUEEN
     (kneeling still)
     We are three queens whose sovereigns fell before
     The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured
     The beaks of ravens, talons of the kites,
     And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.
     He will not suffer us to burn their bones,
     To urn their ashes, nor to take th' offence
     Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye
     Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds
     With stench of our slain lords. O pity, Duke!
     Thou purger of the earth, draw thy feared sword
     That does good turns to th' world; give us the bones
     Of our dead kings that we may chapel them;
     And of thy boundless goodness take some note
     That for our crownäd heads we have no roof,
     Save this, which is the lion's and the bear's,
     And vault to everything.

    THESEUS
     Pray you, kneel not:
     I was transported with your speech, and suffered
     Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes
     Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting
     As wakes my vengeance and revenge for 'em.
     King Capaneus was your lord: the day
     That he should marry you - at such a season
     As now it is with me - I met your groom
     By Mars's altar. You were that time fair,
     Not Juno's mantle fairer than your tresses,
     Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath
     Was then nor threshed nor blasted; fortune at you
     Dimpled her cheek with smiles; Hercules our kinsman -
     Then weaker than your eyes - laid by his club.
     He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide
     And swore his sinews thawed. O grief and time,
     Fearful consumers, you will all devour.

    FIRST QUEEN
     (kneeling still)
     O, I hope some god,
     Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,
     Whereto he'll infuse power and press you forth
     Our undertaker.

    THESEUS
     O no knees, none, widow:
     (The First Queen rises)
     Unto the helmeted Bellona use them
     And pray for me, your soldier. Troubled I am.
     He turns away

    SECOND QUEEN
     (kneeling still)
     Honoured Hippolyta,
     Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain
     The scythe-tusked boar, that with thy arm, as strong
     As it is white, wast near to make the male
     To thy sex captive, but that this, thy lord -
     Born to uphold creation in that honour
     First nature styled it in - shrunk thee into
     The bound thou wast o'erflowing, at once subduing
     Thy force and thy affection; soldieress,
     That equally canst poise sternness with pity,
     Whom now I know hast much more power on him
     Than ever he had on thee, who ow'st his strength,
     And his love too, who is a servant for
     The tenor of thy speech; dear glass of ladies,
     Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,
     Under the shadow of his sword may cool us.
     Require him he advance it o'er our heads.
     Speak't in a woman's key, like such a woman
     As any of us three. Weep ere you fail.
     Lend us a knee:
     But touch the ground for us no longer time
     Than a dove's motion when the head's plucked off.
     Tell him, if he i'th' blood-sized field lay swoll'n,
     Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,
     What you would do.

    HIPPOLYTA
     Poor lady, say no more.
     I had as lief trace this good action with you
     As that whereto I am going, and never yet
     Went I so willing way. My lord is taken
     Heart-deep with your distress. Let him consider.
     I'll speak anon.
     (The Second Queen rises)

    THIRD QUEEN
     (kneeling (still) to Emilia)
     O, my petition was
     Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied
     Melts into drops; so sorrow, wanting form,
     Is pressed with deeper matter.

    EMILIA
     Pray stand up:
     Your grief is written in your cheek.

    THIRD QUEEN
     O woe,
     You cannot read it there; there, through my tears,
     Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,
     You may behold 'em.
     (The Third Queen rises)
     Lady, lady, alack -
     He that will all the treasure know o'th' earth
     Must know the centre too; he that will fish
     For my least minnow, let him lead his line
     To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me:
     Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,
     Makes me a fool.

    EMILIA
     Pray you, say nothing, pray you.
     Who cannot feel nor see the rain, being in't,
     Knows neither wet nor dry. If that you were
     The ground-piece of some painter, I would buy you
     T'instruct me 'gainst a capital grief, indeed
     Such heart-pierced demonstration; but, alas,
     Being a natural sister of our sex,
     Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me
     That it shall make a counter-reflect 'gainst
     My brother's heart, and warm it to some pity,
     Though it were made of stone. Pray have good comfort.

    THESEUS
     Forward to th' temple. Leave not out a jot
     O'th' sacred ceremony.

    FIRST QUEEN
     O, this celebration
     Will longer last and be more costly than
     Your suppliants' war. Remember that your fame
     Knolls in the ear o'th' world: what you do quickly
     Is not done rashly; your first thought is more
     Than others' laboured meditance; your premeditating
     More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,
     Soon as they move, as ospreys do the fish,
     Subdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think
     What beds our slain kings have.

    SECOND QUEEN
     What griefs our beds,
     That our dear lords have none.

    THIRD QUEEN
     None fit for th' dead.
     Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,
     Weary of this world's light, have to themselves
     Been death's most horrid agents, human grace
     Affords them dust and shadow.

    FIRST QUEEN
     But our lords
     Lie blist'ring fore the visitating sun,
     And were good kings, when living.

    THESEUS
     It is true,
     And I will give you comfort to give your dead lords graves,
     The which to do must make some work with Creon.

    FIRST QUEEN
     And that work presents itself to th' doing.
     Now 'twill take form, the heats are gone tomorrow.
     Then, bootless toil must recompense itself
     With its own sweat; now he's secure,
     Not dreams we stand before your puissance
     Rinsing our holy begging in our eyes
     To make petition clear.

    SECOND QUEEN
     Now you may take him,
     Drunk with his victory.

    THIRD QUEEN
     And his army full
     Of bread and sloth.

    THESEUS
     Artesius, that best knowest
     How to draw out, fit to this enterprise
     The prim'st for this proceeding and the number
     To carry such a business: forth and levy
     Our worthiest instruments, whilst we dispatch
     This grand act of our life, this daring deed
     Of fate in wedlock.

    FIRST QUEEN
     (to the other two Queens)
     Dowagers, take hands;
     Let us be widows to our woes; delay
     Commends us to a famishing hope.

    ALL THREE QUEENS
     Farewell.

    SECOND QUEEN
     We come unseasonably, but when could grief
     Cull forth, as unpanged judgement can, fitt'st time
     For best solicitation?

    THESEUS
     Why, good ladies,
     This is a service whereto I am going
     Greater than any war - it more imports me
     Than all the actions that I have foregone,
     Or futurely can cope.

    FIRST QUEEN
     The more proclaiming
     Our suit shall be neglected when her arms,
     Able to lock Jove from a synod, shall
     By warranting moonlight corslet thee! O when
     Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall
     Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think
     Of rotten kings or blubbered queens? What care
     For what thou feel'st not, what thou feel'st being able
     To make Mars spurn his drum? O, if thou couch
     But one night with her, every hour in't will
     Take hostage of thee for a hundred, and
     Thou shalt remember nothing more than what
     That banquet bids thee to.

    HIPPOLYTA
     (to Theseus)
     Though much unlike
     You should be so transported, as much sorry
     I should be such a suitor - yet I think
     Did I not by th' abstaining of my joy,
     Which breeds a deeper longing, cure their surfeit
     That craves a present medicine, I should pluck
     All ladies' scandal on me. (Kneels) Therefore, sir,
     As I shall here make trial of my prayers,
     Either presuming them to have some force,
     Or sentencing for aye their vigour dumb,
     Prorogue this business we are going about, and hang
     Your shield afore your heart - about that neck
     Which is my fee, and which I freely lend
     To do these poor queens service.

    ALL THREE QUEENS
     (to Emilia)
     O, help now,
     Our cause cries for your knee.

    EMILIA
     (kneels to Theseus)
     If you grant not
     My sister her petition in that force
     With that celerity and nature which
     She makes it in, from henceforth I'll not dare
     To ask you anything, nor be so hardy
     Ever to take a husband.

    THESEUS
     Pray stand up.
     (They rise)
     I am entreating of myself to do
     That which you kneel to have me. - Pirithous,
     Lead on the bride: get you and pray the gods
     For success and return; omit not anything
     In the pretended celebration. - Queens,
     Follow your soldier. (To Artesius) As before, hence you,
     And at the banks of Aulis meet us with
     The forces you can raise, where we shall find
     The moiety of a number for a business
     More bigger looked.
     Exit Artesius
     (To Hippolyta) Since that our theme is haste,
     I stamp this kiss upon thy current lip -
     Sweet, keep it as my token. (To the wedding party)Set
     you forward,
     For I will see you gone.
     (To Emilia) Farewell, my beauteous sister. - Pirithous,
     Keep the feast full: bate not an hour on't.

    PIRITHOUS
     Sir,
     I'll follow you at heels. The feast's solemnity
     Shall want till your return.

    THESEUS
     Cousin, I charge you
     Budge not from Athens. We shall be returning
     Ere you can end this feast, of which, I pray you,
     Make no abatement. - Once more, farewell all.
     Exeunt Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous, and train
     towards the temple

    FIRST QUEEN
     Thus dost thou still make good the tongue o'th' world.

    SECOND QUEEN
     And earn'st a deity equal with Mars -

    THIRD QUEEN
     If not above him, for
     Thou being but mortal mak'st affections bend
     To godlike honours; they themselves, some say,
     Groan under such a mast'ry.

    THESEUS
     As we are men,
     Thus should we do; being sensually subdued
     We lose our human title. Good cheer, ladies.
     Now turn we towards your comforts.
     (Flourish.) Exeunt

 1.2 Scene 2
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter Palamon and Arcite

    ARCITE
     Dear Palamon, dearer in love than blood,
     And our prime cousin, yet unhardened in
     The crimes of nature, let us leave the city,
     Thebes, and the temptings in't, before we further
     Sully our gloss of youth.
     And here to keep in abstinence we shame
     As in incontinence; for not to swim
     I'th' aid o'th' current were almost to sink -
     At least to frustrate striving; and to follow
     The common stream 'twould bring us to an eddy
     Where we should turn or drown; if labour through,
     Our gain but life and weakness.

    PALAMON
     Your advice
     Is cried up with example. What strange ruins
     Since first we went to school may we perceive
     Walking in Thebes? Scars and bare weeds
     The gain o'th' martialist who did propound
     To his bold ends honour and golden ingots,
     Which though he won, he had not; and now flirted
     By peace for whom he fought. Who then shall offer
     To Mars's so-scorned altar? I do bleed
     When such I meet, and wish great Juno would
     Resume her ancient fit of jealousy
     To get the soldier work, that peace might purge
     For her repletion and retain anew
     Her charitable heart, now hard and harsher
     Than strife or war could be.

    ARCITE
     Are you not out?
     Meet you no ruin but the soldier in
     The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin
     As if you met decays of many kinds.
     Perceive you none that do arouse your pity
     But th' unconsidered soldier?

    PALAMON
     Yes, I pity
     Decays where'er I find them, but such most
     That, sweating in an honourable toil,
     Are paid with ice to cool 'em.

    ARCITE
     'Tis not this
     I did begin to speak of. This is virtue,
     Of no respect in Thebes. I spake of Thebes,
     How dangerous, if we will keep our honours,
     It is for our residing where every evil
     Hath a good colour, where every seeming good's
     A certain evil, where not to be ev'n jump
     As they are here were to be strangers, and
     Such things to be, mere monsters.

    PALAMON
     'Tis in our power,
     Unless we fear that apes can tutor's, to
     Be masters of our manners. What need I
     Affect another's gait, which is not catching
     Where there is faith? Or to be fond upon
     Another's way of speech, when by mine own
     I may be reasonably conceived - saved, too -
     Speaking it truly? Why am I bound
     By any generous bond to follow him
     Follows his tailor, haply so long until
     The followed make pursuit? Or let me know
     Why mine own barber is unblest - with him
     My poor chin, too - for'tis not scissored just
     To such a favourite's glass? What canon is there
     That does command my rapier from my hip
     To dangle't in my hand? Or to go tiptoe
     Before the street be foul? Either I am
     The fore-horse in the team or I am none
     That draw i'th' sequent trace. These poor slight sores
     Need not a plantain. That which rips my bosom
     Almost to th' heart's -

    ARCITE
     Our uncle Creon.

    PALAMON
     He,
     A most unbounded tyrant, whose successes
     Makes heaven unfeared and villainy assured
     Beyond its power there's nothing; almost puts
     Faith in a fever, and deifies alone
     Voluble chance; who only attributes
     The faculties of other instruments
     To his own nerves and act; commands men's service,
     And what they win in't, boot and glory; one
     That fears not to do harm, good dares not. Let
     The blood of mine that's sib to him be sucked
     From me with leeches. Let them break and fall
     Off me with that corruption.

    ARCITE
     Clear-spirited cousin,
     Let's leave his court that we may nothing share
     Of his loud infamy: for our milk
     Will relish of the pasture, and we must
     Be vile or disobedient; not his kinsmen
     In blood unless in quality.

    PALAMON
     Nothing truer.
     I think the echoes of his shames have deafed
     The ears of heav'nly justice. Widows' cries
     Descend again into their throats and have not
     Enter Valerius
     Due audience of the gods - Valerius.

    VALERIUS
     The King calls for you; yet be leaden-footed
     Till his great rage be off him. Phoebus, when
     He broke his whipstock and exclaimed against
     The horses of the sun, but whispered to
     The loudness of his fury.

    PALAMON
     Small winds shake him.
     But what's the matter?

    VALERIUS
     Theseus, who where he threats, appals, hath sent
     Deadly defiance to him and pronounces
     Ruin to Thebes, who is at hand to seal
     The promise of his wrath.

    ARCITE
     Let him approach.
     But that we fear the gods in him, he brings not
     A jot of terror to us. Yet what man
     Thirds his own worth - the case is each of ours -
     When that his action's dregged with mind assured
     'Tis bad he goes about.

    PALAMON
     Leave that unreasoned.
     Our services stand now for Thebes, not Creon,
     Yet to be neutral to him were dishonour,
     Rebellious to oppose. Therefore we must
     With him stand to the mercy of our fate,
     Who hath bounded our last minute.

    ARCITE
     So we must.
     Is't said this war's afoot? Or it shall be
     On fail of some condition?

    VALERIUS
     'Tis in motion,
     The intelligence of state came in the instant
     With the defier.

    PALAMON
     Let's to the King, who, were he
     A quarter carrier of that honour which
     His enemy come in, the blood we venture
     Should be as for our health, which were not spent,
     Rather laid out for purchase. But, alas,
     Our hands advanced before our hearts, what will
     The fall o'th' stroke do damage?

    ARCITE
     Let th' event -
     That never-erring arbitrator - tell us
     When we know all ourselves, and let us follow
     The becking of our chance.

     Enter Pirithous, Hippolyta, and Emilia

    PIRITHOUS
     No further.

    HIPPOLYTA
     Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishes
     To our great lord, of whose success I dare not
     Make any timorous question; yet I wish him
     Excess and overflow of power, an't might be,
     To dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him;
     Store never hurts good governors.

    PIRITHOUS
     Though I know
     His ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they
     Must yield their tribute there. (To Emilia) My precious
     maid,
     Those best affections that the heavens infuse
     In their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned
     In your dear heart.

    EMILIA
     Thanks, sir. Remember me
     To our all-royal brother, for whose speed
     The great Bellona I'll solicit; and
     Since in our terrene state petitions are not
     Without gifts understood, I'll offer to her
     What I shall be advised she likes. Our hearts
     Are in his army, in his tent.

    HIPPOLYTA
     In's bosom.
     We have been soldiers, and we cannot weep
     When our friends don their helms, or put to sea,
     Or tell of babes broached on the lance, or women
     That have sod their infants in - and after eat them -
     The brine they wept at killing 'em: then if
     You stay to see of us such spinsters, we
     Should hold you here forever.

    PIRITHOUS
     Peace be to you
     As I pursue this war, which shall be then
     Beyond further requiring.
     Exit Pirithous

    EMILIA
     How his longing
     Follows his friend! Since his depart, his sports,
     Though craving seriousness and skill, passed slightly
     His careless execution, where nor gain
     Made him regard or loss consider, but
     Playing one business in his hand, another
     Directing in his head, his mind nurse equal
     To these so diff'ring twins. Have you observed him
     Since our great lord departed?

    HIPPOLYTA
     With much labour;
     And I did love him for't. They two have cabined
     In many as dangerous as poor a corner,
     Peril and want contending; they have skiffed
     Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power
     I'th' least of these was dreadful, and they have
     Fought out together where death's self was lodged;
     Yet fate hath brought them off. Their knot of love,
     Tied, weaved, entangled with so true, so long,
     And with a finger of so deep a cunning,
     May be outworn, never undone. I think
     Theseus cannot be umpire to himself,
     Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing
     Each side like justice, which he loves best.

    EMILIA
     Doubtless
     There is a best, and reason has no manners
     To say it is not you. I was acquainted
     Once with a time when I enjoyed a playfellow;
     You were at wars when she the grave enriched,
     Who made too proud the bed; took leave o'th' moon -
     Which then looked pale at parting - when our count
     Was each eleven.

    HIPPOLYTA
     'Twas Flavina.

    EMILIA
     Yes.
     You talk of Pirithous' and Theseus' love:
     Theirs has more ground, is more maturely seasoned,
     More buckled with strong judgement, and their needs
     The one of th' other may be said to water
     Their intertangled roots of love; but I
     And she I sigh and spoke of were things innocent,
     Loved for we did, and like the elements,
     That know not what, nor why, yet do effect
     Rare issues by their operance, our souls
     Did so to one another. What she liked
     Was then of me approved; what not, condemned -
     No more arraignment. The flower that I would pluck
     And put between my breasts - O then but beginning
     To swell about the blossom - she would long
     Till she had such another, and commit it
     To the like innocent cradle, where, phoenix-like,
     They died in perfume. On my head no toy
     But was her pattern. Her affections - pretty,
     Though happily her careless wear - I followed
     For my most serious decking. Had mine ear
     Stol'n some new air, or at adventure hummed one,
     From musical coinage, why, it was a note
     Whereon her spirits would sojourn - rather dwell on -
     And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal -
     Which, seely innocence wots well, comes in
     Like old emportment's bastard - has this end:
     That the true love 'tween maid and maid may be
     More than in sex dividual.

    HIPPOLYTA
     You're out of breath,
     And this high-speeded pace is but to say
     That you shall never, like the maid Flavina,
     Love any that's called man.

    EMILIA
     I am sure I shall not.

    HIPPOLYTA
     Now alack, weak sister,
     I must no more believe thee in this point -
     Though in't I know thou dost believe thyself -
     Than I will trust a sickly appetite
     That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,
     If I were ripe for your persuasion, you
     Have said enough to shake me from the arm
     Of the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunes
     I will now in and kneel, with great assurance
     That we more than his Pirithous possess
     The high throne in his heart.

    EMILIA
     I am not
     Against your faith, yet I continue mine.
     Exeunt

     Cornetts. A battle struck within. Then a retreat.
     Flourish. Then enter Theseus, victor. The three Queens meet
     him and fall on their faces before him.
     (Also enter a Herald, and attendants bearing
     Palamon and Arcite on two hearses)

    FIRST QUEEN
     (to Theseus)
     To thee no star be dark.

    SECOND QUEEN
     (to Theseus)
     Both heaven and
     earthFriend thee for ever.

    THIRD QUEEN
     (to Theseus)
     All the good that may
     Be wished upon thy head, I cry 'Amen' to't.

    THESEUS
     Th'impartial gods, who from the mounted heavens
     View us their mortal herd, behold who err
     And in their time chastise. Go and find out
     The bones of your dead lords and honour them
     With treble ceremony: rather than a gap
     Should be in their dear rites we would supply't.
     But those we will depute which shall invest
     You in your dignities, and even each thing
     Our haste does leave imperfect. So adieu,
     And heaven's good eyes look on you.
     Exeunt the Queens
     What are those?

    HERALD
     Men of great quality, as may be judged
     By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told's
     They are sisters' children, nephews to the King.

    THESEUS
     By th' helm of Mars I saw them in the war,
     Like to a pair of lions smeared with prey,
     Make lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my note
     Constantly on them, for they were a mark
     Worth a god's view. What prisoner was't that told me
     When I enquired their names?

    HERALD
     Wi' leave, they're called
     Arcite and Palamon.

    THESEUS
     'Tis right: those, those.
     They are not dead?

    HERALD
     Nor in a state of life. Had they been taken
     When their last hurts were given, 'twas possible
     They might have been recovered. Yet they breathe,
     And have the name of men.

    THESEUS
     Then like men use 'em.
     The very lees of such, millions of rates
     Exceed the wine of others. All our surgeons
     Convent in their behoof; our richest balms,
     Rather than niggard, waste. Their lives concern us
     Much more than Thebes is worth. Rather than have 'em
     Freed of this plight and in their morning state -
     Sound and at liberty - I would 'em dead;
     But forty-thousandfold we had rather have 'em
     Prisoners to us, than death. Bear 'em speedily
     From our kind air, to them unkind, and minister
     What man to man may do - for our sake, more,
     Since I have known frights, fury, friends' behests,
     Love's provocations, zeal, a mistress' task,
     Desire of liberty, a fever, madness,
     Hath set a mark which nature could not reach to
     Without some imposition, sickness in will
     O'er-wrestling strength in reason. For our love
     And great Apollo's mercy, all our best
     Their best skill tender. - Lead into the city
     Where, having bound things scattered, we will post
     To Athens fore our army.
     Flourish. Exeunt

     Music. Enter the three Queens with the hearses of
     their lords in a funeral solemnity, with attendants
     Song
            Urns and odours, bring away,
            Vapours, sighs, darken the day;
            Our dole more deadly looks than dying.
            Balms and gums and heavy cheers,
            Sacred vials filled with tears,
            And clamours through the wild air flying:
            Come all sad and solemn shows,
            That are quick-eyed pleasure's foes.
            We convent naught else but woes,
            We convent naught else but woes.

    THIRD QUEEN
     This funeral path brings to your household's grave -
     Joy seize on you again, peace sleep with him.

    SECOND QUEEN
     And this to yours.

    FIRST QUEEN
     Yours this way. Heavens lend
     A thousand differing ways to one sure end.

    THIRD QUEEN

 2.1 Scene 1
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter the Jailer and the Wooer

    JAILER
     I may depart with little, while I live; something I
     may cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep,
     though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come;
     before one salmon you shall take a number of minnows.
     I am given out to be better lined than it can appear to
     me report is a true speaker. I would I were really that
     I am delivered to be. Marry, what I have - be it what
     it will - I will assure upon my daughter at the day of
     my death.

    WOOER
     Sir, I demand no more than your own offer, and
     I will estate your daughter in what I have promised.

    JAILER
     Well, we will talk more of this when the solemnity
     is past. But have you a full promise of her?
     Enter the Jailer's Daughter with rushes
     When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.

    WOOER
     I have, sir. Here she comes.

    JAILER
     (to Daughter)
     Your friend and I have chanced to
     name you here, upon the old business - but no more
     of that now. So soon as the court hurry is over we will
     have an end of it. I'th' mean time, look tenderly to the
     two prisoners. I can tell you they are princes.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     These strewings are for their chamber.
     'Tis pity they are in prison, and 'twere pity they should
     be out. I do think they have patience to make any
     adversity ashamed; the prison itself is proud of 'em,
     and they have all the world in their chamber.

    JAILER
     They are famed to be a pair of absolute men.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     By my troth, I think fame but stammers
     'em - they stand a grece above the reach of report.

    JAILER
     I heard them reported in the battle to be the only
     doers.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Nay, most likely, for they are noble
     sufferers. I marvel how they would have looked had
     they been victors, that with such a constant nobility
     enforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their
     mirth, and affliction a toy to jest at.

    JAILER
     Do they so?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     It seems to me they have no more
     sense of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They
     eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but
     nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet
     sometime a divided sigh - martyred as 'twere i'th'
     deliverance - will break from one of them, when the
     other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I could
     wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least a sigher
     to be comforted.

    WOOER
     I never saw 'em.

    JAILER
     The Duke himself came privately in the night,
     Palamon and Arcite appear (at a window) above
     and so did they. What the reason of it is I know not.
     Look, yonder they are. That's Arcite looks out.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     No, sir, no - that's Palamon. Arcite is
     the lower of the twain - (pointing at Arcite) you may
     perceive a part of him.

    JAILER
     Go to, leave your pointing. They would not make
     us their object. Out of their sight.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     It is a holiday to look on them. Lord,
     the difference of men!
     Exeunt

 2.2 Scene 2
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter Palamon and Arcite in prison, (in shackles,
     above)

    PALAMON
     How do you, noble cousin?

    ARCITE
     How do you, sir?

    PALAMON
     Why, strong enough to laugh at misery
     And bear the chance of war. Yet we are prisoners,
     I fear, for ever, cousin.

    ARCITE
     I believe it,
     And to that destiny have patiently
     Laid up my hour to come.

    PALAMON
     O, cousin Arcite,
     Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?
     Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more
     Must we behold those comforts, never see
     The hardy youths strive for the games of honour,
     Hung with the painted favours of their ladies,
     Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst 'em
     And, as an east wind, leave 'em all behind us,
     Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,
     Even in the wagging of a wanton leg,
     Outstripped the people's praises, won the garlands
     Ere they have time to wish 'em ours. O never
     Shall we two exercise, like twins of honour,
     Our arms again and feel our fiery horses
     Like proud seas under us. Our good swords, now -
     Better the red-eyed god of war ne'er wore -
     Ravished our sides, like age must run to rust
     And deck the temples of those gods that hate us.
     These hands shall never draw 'em out like lightning
     To blast whole armies more.

    ARCITE
     No, Palamon,
     Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,
     And here the graces of our youths must wither,
     Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us
     And, which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried -
     The sweet embraces of a loving wife
     Loaden with kisses, armed with thousand Cupids,
     Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us;
     No figures of ourselves shall we e'er see
     To glad our age, and, like young eagles, teach 'em
     Boldly to gaze against bright arms and say,
     'Remember what your fathers were, and conquer.'
     The fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishments,
     And in their songs curse ever-blinded fortune,
     Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done
     To youth and nature. This is all our world.
     We shall know nothing here but one another,
     Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes.
     The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;
     Summer shall come, and with her all delights,
     But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.

    PALAMON
     'Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds
     That shook the agäd forest with their echoes,
     No more now must we holler; no more shake
     Our pointed javelins whilst the angry swine
     Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,
     Struck with our well-steeled darts. All valiant uses -
     The food and nourishment of noble minds -
     In us two here shall perish; we shall die -
     Which is the curse of honour - lastly,
     Children of grief and ignorance.

    ARCITE
     Yet, cousin,
     Even from the bottom of these miseries,
     From all that fortune can inflict upon us,
     I see two comforts rising - two mere blessings,
     If the gods please, to hold here a brave patience
     And the enjoying of our griefs together.
     Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish
     If I think this our prison.

    PALAMON
     Certainly
     'Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes
     Were twined together. 'Tis most true, two souls
     Put in two noble bodies, let 'em suffer
     The gall of hazard, so they grow together,
     Will never sink; they must not, say they could.
     A willing man dies sleeping and all's done.

    ARCITE
     Shall we make worthy uses of this place
     That all men hate so much?

    PALAMON
     How, gentle cousin?

    ARCITE
     Let's think this prison holy sanctuary,
     To keep us from corruption of worse men.
     We are young, and yet desire the ways of honour
     That liberty and common conversation,
     The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,
     Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing
     Can be, but our imaginations
     May make it ours? And here being thus together,
     We are an endless mine to one another:
     We are one another's wife, ever begetting
     New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;
     We are in one another, families -
     I am your heir, and you are mine; this place
     Is our inheritance: no hard oppressor
     Dare take this from us. Here, with a little patience,
     We shall live long and loving. No surfeits seek us -
     The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas
     Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty
     A wife might part us lawfully, or business;
     Quarrels consume us; envy of ill men
     Crave our acquaintance. I might sicken, cousin,
     Where you should never know it, and so perish
     Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,
     Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,
     Were we from hence, would sever us.

    PALAMON
     You have made me -
     I thank you, cousin Arcite - almost wanton
     With my captivity. What a misery
     It is to live abroad, and everywhere!
     'Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here;
     I am sure, a more content; and all those pleasures
     That woo the wills of men to vanity
     I see through now, and am sufficient
     To tell the world 'tis but a gaudy shadow,
     That old Time, as he passes by, takes with him.
     What had we been, old in the court of Creon,
     Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance
     The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,
     Had not the loving gods found this place for us,
     We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,
     And had their epitaphs, the people's curses.
     Shall I say more?

    ARCITE
     I would hear you still.

    PALAMON
     Ye shall.
     Is there record of any two that loved
     Better than we do, Arcite?

    ARCITE
     Sure there cannot.

    PALAMON
     I do not think it possible our friendship
     Should ever leave us.

    ARCITE
     Till our deaths it cannot,
     Enter Emilia and her Woman (below). Palamon sees
     Emilia and is silent
     And after death our spirits shall be led
     To those that love eternally. Speak on, sir.

    EMILIA
     (to her Woman)
     This garden has a world of pleasure in't.
     What flower is this?

    WOMAN
     'Tis called narcissus, madam.

    EMILIA
     That was a fair boy, certain, but a fool
     To love himself. Were there not maids enough?

    ARCITE
     (to Palamon)
     Pray forward.

    PALAMON
     Yes.

    EMILIA
     (to her Woman)
     Or were they all hard-hearted?

    WOMAN
     They could not be to one so fair.

    EMILIA
     Thou wouldst not.

    WOMAN
     I think I should not, madam.

    EMILIA
     That's a good wench -
     But take heed to your kindness, though.

    WOMAN
     Why, madam?

    EMILIA
     Men are mad things.

    ARCITE
     (to Palamon)
     Will ye go forward, cousin?

    EMILIA
     (to her Woman)
     Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?

    WOMAN
     Yes.

    EMILIA
     I'll have a gown full of 'em, and of these.
     This is a pretty colour - will't not do
     Rarely upon a skirt, wench?

    WOMAN
     Dainty, madam.

    ARCITE
     (to Palamon)
     Cousin, cousin, how do you, sir? Why, Palamon!

    PALAMON
     Never till now was I in prison, Arcite.

    ARCITE
     Why, what's the matter, man?

    PALAMON
     Behold and wonder!
     Arcite sees Emilia
     By heaven, she is a goddess!

    ARCITE
     Ha!

    PALAMON
     Do reverence.
     She is a goddess, Arcite.

    EMILIA
     (to her Woman)
     Of all flowers
     Methinks a rose is best.

    WOMAN
     Why, gentle madam?

    EMILIA
     It is the very emblem of a maid -
     For when the west wind courts her gently,
     How modestly she blows, and paints the sun
     With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her,
     Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,
     She locks her beauties in her bud again,
     And leaves him to base briers.

    WOMAN
     Yet, good madam,
     Sometimes her modesty will blow so far
     She falls for't - a maid,
     If she have any honour, would be loath
     To take example by her.

    EMILIA
     Thou art wanton.

    ARCITE
     (to Palamon)
     She is wondrous fair.

    PALAMON
     She is all the beauty extant.

    EMILIA
     (to her Woman)
     The sun grows high - let's walk in. Keep these flowers.
     We'll see how close art can come near their colours.
     I am wondrous merry-hearted - I could laugh now.

    WOMAN
     I could lie down, I am sure.

    EMILIA
     And take one with you?

    WOMAN
     That's as we bargain, madam.

    EMILIA
     Well, agree then.
     Exeunt Emilia and her Woman

    PALAMON
     What think you of this beauty?

    ARCITE
     'Tis a rare one.

    PALAMON
     Is't but a rare one?

    ARCITE
     Yes, a matchless beauty.

    PALAMON
     Might not a man well lose himself and love her?

    ARCITE
     I cannot tell what you have done; I have,
     Beshrew mine eyes for't. Now I feel my shackles.

    PALAMON
     You love her then?

    ARCITE
     Who would not?

    PALAMON
     And desire her?

    ARCITE
     Before my liberty.

    PALAMON
     I saw her first.

    ARCITE
     That's nothing.

    PALAMON
     But it shall be.

    ARCITE
     I saw her too.

    PALAMON
     Yes, but you must not love her.

    ARCITE
     I will not, as you do, to worship her
     As she is heavenly and a blessäd goddess!
     I love her as a woman, to enjoy her -
     So both may love.

    PALAMON
     You shall not love at all.

    ARCITE
     Not love at all - who shall deny me?

    PALAMON
     I that first saw her, I that took possession
     First with mine eye of all those beauties
     In her revealed to mankind. If thou lov'st her,
     Or entertain'st a hope to blast my wishes,
     Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow
     False as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,
     And all the ties between us I disclaim,
     If thou once think upon her.

    ARCITE
     Yes, I love her -
     And if the lives of all my name lay on it,
     I must do so. I love her with my soul -
     If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon!
     I say again,
     I love her, and in loving her maintain
     I am as worthy and as free a lover,
     And have as just a title to her beauty,
     As any Palamon, or any living
     That is a man's son.

    PALAMON
     Have I called thee friend?

    ARCITE
     Yes, and have found me so. Why are you moved thus?
     Let me deal coldly with you. Am not I
     Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me
     That I was Palamon and you were Arcite.

    PALAMON
     Yes.

    ARCITE
     Am not I liable to those affections,
     Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?

    PALAMON
     Ye may be.

    ARCITE
     Why then would you deal so cunningly,
     So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,
     To love alone? Speak truly. Do you think me
     Unworthy of her sight?

    PALAMON
     No, but unjust
     If thou pursue that sight.

    ARCITE
     Because another
     First sees the enemy, shall I stand still,
     And let mine honour down, and never charge?

    PALAMON
     Yes, if he be but one.

    ARCITE
     But say that one
     Had rather combat me?

    PALAMON
     Let that one say so,
     And use thy freedom; else, if thou pursuest her,
     Be as that cursäd man that hates his country,
     A branded villain.

    ARCITE
     You are mad.

    PALAMON
     I must be.
     Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me;
     And in this madness if I hazard thee
     And take thy life, I deal but truly.

    ARCITE
     Fie, sir.
     You play the child extremely. I will love her,
     I must, I ought to do so, and I dare -
     And all this justly.

    PALAMON
     O, that now, that now
     Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune -
     To be one hour at liberty and grasp
     Our good swords in our hands! I would quickly teach thee
     What 'twere to filch affection from another.
     Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.
     Put but thy head out of this window more
     And, as I have a soul, I'll nail thy life to't.

    ARCITE
     Thou dar'st not, fool; thou canst not; thou art feeble.
     Put my head out? I'll throw my body out
     And leap the garden when I see her next,
     Enter the Jailer (above)
     And pitch between her arms to anger thee.

    PALAMON
     No more - the keeper's coming. I shall live
     To knock thy brains out with my shackles.

    ARCITE
     Do.

    JAILER
     By your leave, gentlemen.

    PALAMON
     Now, honest keeper?

    JAILER
     Lord Arcite, you must presently to th' Duke.
     The cause I know not yet.

    ARCITE
     I am ready, keeper.

    JAILER
     Prince Palamon, I must a while bereave you
     Of your fair cousin's company.
     Exeunt Arcite and the Jailer

    PALAMON
     And me, too,
     Even when you please, of life. Why is he sent for?
     It may be he shall marry her - he's goodly,
     And like enough the Duke hath taken notice
     Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood!
     Why should a friend be treacherous? If that
     Get him a wife so noble and so fair,
     Let honest men ne'er love again. Once more
     I would but see this fair one. Blessäd garden,
     And fruit and flowers more blessäd, that still blossom
     As her bright eyes shine on ye! Would I were,
     For all the fortune of my life hereafter,
     Yon little tree, yon blooming apricot -
     How I would spread and fling my wanton arms
     In at her window! I would bring her fruit
     Fit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure
     Still as she tasted should be doubled on her;
     And if she be not heavenly, I would make her
     So near the gods in nature they should fear her -
     Enter the Jailer (above)
     And then I am sure she would love me. How now, keeper,
     Where's Arcite?

    JAILER
     Banished - Prince Pirithous
     Obtained his liberty; but never more,
     Upon his oath and life, must he set foot
     Upon this kingdom.

    PALAMON
     (aside)
     He's a blessäd man.
     He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms
     The bold young men that, when he bids 'em charge,
     Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,
     If he dare make himself a worthy lover,
     Yet in the field to strike a battle for her;
     And if he lose her then, he's a cold coward.
     How bravely may he bear himself to win her
     If he be noble Arcite; thousand ways!
     Were I at liberty I would do things
     Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady,
     This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her
     And seek to ravish me.

    JAILER
     My lord, for you
     I have this charge to -

    PALAMON
     To discharge my life.

    JAILER
     No, but from this place to remove your lordship -
     The windows are too open.

    PALAMON
     Devils take 'em
     That are so envious to me - prithee kill me.

    JAILER
     And hang for't afterward?

    PALAMON
     By this good light,
     Had I a sword I would kill thee.

    JAILER
     Why, my lord?

    PALAMON
     Thou bring'st such pelting scurvy news continually,
     Thou art not worthy life. I will not go.

    JAILER
     Indeed you must, my lord.

    PALAMON
     May I see the garden?

    JAILER
     No.

    PALAMON
     Then I am resolved - I will not go.

    JAILER
     I must constrain you, then; and for you are dangerous,
     I'll clap more irons on you.

    PALAMON
     Do, good keeper.
     I'll shake 'em so ye shall not sleep:
     I'll make ye a new morris. Must I go?

    JAILER
     There is no remedy.

    PALAMON
     Farewell, kind window.
     May rude wind never hurt thee. O, my lady,
     If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,
     Dream how I suffer. Come, now bury me.
     Exeunt Palamon and the Jailer

     Enter Arcite

    ARCITE
     Banished the kingdom? 'Tis a benefit,
     A mercy I must thank 'em for; but banished
     The free enjoying of that face I die for -
     O, 'twas a studied punishment, a death
     Beyond imagination; such a vengeance
     That, were I old and wicked, all my sins
     Could never pluck upon me. Palamon,
     Thou hast the start now - thou shalt stay and see
     Her bright eyes break each morning 'gainst thy window,
     And let in life into thee. Thou shalt feed
     Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty
     That nature ne'er exceeded, nor ne'er shall.
     Good gods! What happiness has Palamon!
     Twenty to one he'll come to speak to her,
     And if she be as gentle as she's fair,
     I know she's his - he has a tongue will tame
     Tempests and make the wild rocks wanton.
     Come what can come,
     The worst is death. I will not leave the kingdom.
     I know mine own is but a heap of ruins,
     And no redress there. If I go he has her.
     I am resolved another shape shall make me,
     Or end my fortunes. Either way I am happy -
     I'll see her and be near her, or no more.
     Enter four Country People, one of whom carries a
     garland before them. Arcite stands apart

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     My masters, I'll be there - that's certain.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     And I'll be there.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     And I.

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Why then, have with ye, boys! 'Tis but a chiding -
     Let the plough play today, I'll tickle't out
     Of the jades' tails tomorrow.

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     I am sure
     To have my wife as jealous as a turkey -
     But that's all one. I'll go through, let her mumble.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     Clap her aboard tomorrow night and stow her,
     And all's made up again.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     Ay, do but put
     A fescue in her fist and you shall see her
     Take a new lesson out and be a good wench.
     Do we all hold against the maying?

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Hold? What should ail us?

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     Arcas will be there.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     And Sennois, and Rycas, and three
     better lads ne'er danced under green tree; and ye know
     what wenches, ha? But will the dainty dominie, the
     schoolmaster, keep touch, do you think? For he does
     all, ye know.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     He'll eat a hornbook ere he fail. Go
     to, the matter's too far driven between him and the
     tanner's daughter to let slip now, and she must see the
     Duke, and she must dance too.

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Shall we be lusty?

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     All the boys in Athens blow wind
     i'th' breech on's! And here I'll be and there I'll be, for
     our town, and here again and there again - ha, boys,
     hey for the weavers!

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     This must be done i'th' woods.

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     O, pardon me.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     By any means, our thing of learning
     said so; where he himself will edify the Duke most
     parlously in our behalfs - he's excellent i'th' woods,
     bring him to th' plains, his learning makes no cry.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     We'll see the sports, then every man
     to's tackle - and, sweet companions, let's rehearse, by
     any means, before the ladies see us, and do sweetly,
     and God knows what may come on't.

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Content - the sports once ended,
     we'll perform. Away boys, and hold.

    ARCITE
     (coming forward)
     By your leaves, honest friends, pray you whither go you?

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Whither? Why, what a question's that?

    ARCITE
     Yet 'tis a question
     To me that know not.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     To the games, my friend.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     Where were you bred, you know it not?

    ARCITE
     Not far, sir -
     Are there such games today?

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     Yes, marry, are there,
     And such as you never saw. The Duke himself
     Will be in person there.

    ARCITE
     What pastimes are they?

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     Wrestling and running. (To the others) 'Tis a pretty
     fellow.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     (to Arcite)
     Thou wilt not go along?

    ARCITE
     Not yet, sir.

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Well, sir,
     Take your own time. (To the others) Come, boys.

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     My mind misgives me -
     This fellow has a vengeance trick o'th' hip:
     Mark how his body's made for't.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     I'll be hanged though
     If he dare venture; hang him, plum porridge!
     He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come, let's be gone, lads.
     Exeunt the four Countrymen

    ARCITE
     This is an offered opportunity
     I durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled -
     The best men called it excellent - and run
     Swifter than wind upon a field of corn,
     Curling the wealthy ears, never flew. I'll venture,
     And in some poor disguise be there. Who knows
     Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands,
     And happiness prefer me to a place
     Where I may ever dwell in sight of her?
     Exit

 2.4 Scene 4
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter the Jailer's Daughter

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Why should I love this gentleman? 'Tis odds
     He never will affect me. I am base,
     My father the mean keeper of his prison,
     And he a prince. To marry him is hopeless,
     To be his whore is witless. Out upon't,
     What pushes are we wenches driven to
     When fifteen once has found us? First, I saw him;
     I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;
     He has as much to please a woman in him -
     If he please to bestow it so - as ever
     These eyes yet looked on. Next, I pitied him,
     And so would any young wench, o' my conscience,
     That ever dreamed or vowed her maidenhead
     To a young handsome man. Then, I loved him,
     Extremely loved him, infinitely loved him -
     And yet he had a cousin fair as he, too.
     But in my heart was Palamon, and there,
     Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him
     Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!
     And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken
     Was never gentleman. When I come in
     To bring him water in a morning, first
     He bows his noble body, then salutes me, thus:
     'Fair, gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness
     Get thee a happy husband.' Once he kissed me -
     I loved my lips the better ten days after.
     Would he would do so every day! He grieves much,
     And me as much to see his misery.
     What should I do to make him know I love him?
     For I would fain enjoy him. Say I ventured
     To set him free? What says the law then? Thus much
     For law or kindred! I will do it,
     And this night; ere tomorrow he shall love me.
     Exit

     Short flourish of cornetts and shouts within.
     Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Emilia, Arcite
     disguised, with a  garland, and attendants

    THESEUS
     You have done worthily. I have not seen
     Since Hercules a man of tougher sinews.
     Whate'er you are, you run the best and wrestle
     That these times can allow.

    ARCITE
     I am proud to please you.

    THESEUS
     What country bred you?

    ARCITE
     This - but far off, prince.

    THESEUS
     Are you a gentleman?

    ARCITE
     My father said so,
     And to those gentle uses gave me life.

    THESEUS
     Are you his heir?

    ARCITE
     His youngest, sir.

    THESEUS
     Your father
     Sure is a happy sire, then. What proves you?

    ARCITE
     A little of all noble qualities.
     I could have kept a hawk and well have hollered
     To a deep cry of dogs; I dare not praise
     My feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew me
     Would say it was my best piece; last and greatest,
     I would be thought a soldier.

    THESEUS
     You are perfect.

    PIRITHOUS
     Upon my soul, a proper man.

    EMILIA
     He is so.

    PIRITHOUS
     (to Hippolyta)
     How do you like him, lady?

    HIPPOLYTA
     I admire him.
     I have not seen so young a man so noble -
     If he say true - of his sort.

    EMILIA
     Believe
     His mother was a wondrous handsome woman -
     His face methinks goes that way.

    HIPPOLYTA
     But his body
     And fiery mind illustrate a brave father.

    PIRITHOUS
     Mark how his virtue, like a hidden sun,
     Breaks through his baser garments.

    HIPPOLYTA
     He's well got, sure.

    THESEUS
     (to Arcite)
     What made you seek this place, sir?

    ARCITE
     Noble Theseus,
     To purchase name and do my ablest service
     To such a well-found wonder as thy worth,
     For only in thy court of all the world
     Dwells fair-eyed honour.

    PIRITHOUS
     All his words are worthy.

    THESEUS
     (to Arcite)
     Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,
     Nor shall you lose your wish. - Pirithous,
     Dispose of this fair gentleman.

    PIRITHOUS
     Thanks, Theseus.
     (To Arcite) Whate'er you are, you're mine, and I shall
     give you
     To a most noble service, to this lady,
     This bright young virgin; pray observe her goodness.
     You have honoured her fair birthday with your virtues,
     And as your due you're hers. Kiss her fair hand, sir.

    ARCITE
     Sir, you're a noble giver. (To Emilia) Dearest beauty,
     Thus let me seal my vowed faith.
     He kisses her hand
     When your servant,
     Your most unworthy creature, but offends you,
     Command him die, he shall.

    EMILIA
     That were too cruel.
     If you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see't.
     You're mine, and somewhat better than your rank I'll use you.

    PIRITHOUS
     (to Arcite)
     I'll see you furnished, and, because you say
     You are a horseman, I must needs entreat you
     This afternoon to ride - but 'tis a rough one.

    ARCITE
     I like him better, prince - I shall not then
     Freeze in my saddle.

    THESEUS
     (to Hippolyta)
     Sweet, you must be ready -
     And you, Emilia, (to Pirithous) and you, friend -
     and all,
     Tomorrow by the sun, to do observance
     To flow'ry May in Dian's wood. (To Arcite) Wait well,
     sir,
     Upon your mistress. - Emily, I hope
     He shall not go afoot.

    EMILIA
     That were a shame, sir,
     While I have horses. (To Arcite) Take your choice, and
     what
     You want, at any time, let me but know it.
     If you serve faithfully, I dare assure you,
     You'll find a loving mistress.

    ARCITE
     If I do not,
     Let me find that my father ever hated -
     Disgrace and blows.

    THESEUS
     Go, lead the way - you have won it.
     It shall be so: you shall receive all dues
     Fit for the honour you have won. 'Twere wrong else.
     (To Emilia) Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a
     servant
     That, if I were a woman, would be master.
     But you are wise.

    EMILIA
     I hope too wise for that, sir.

     Enter the Jailer's Daughter

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Let all the dukes and all the devils roar -
     He is at liberty! I have ventured for him,
     And out I have brought him. To a little wood
     A mile hence I have sent him, where a cedar
     Higher than all the rest spreads like a plane,
     Fast by a brook - and there he shall keep close
     Till I provide him files and food, for yet
     His iron bracelets are not off. O Love,
     What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father
     Durst better have endured cold iron than done it.
     I love him beyond love and beyond reason
     Or wit or safety. I have made him know it -
     I care not, I am desperate. If the law
     Find me and then condemn me for't, some wenches,
     Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge
     And tell to memory my death was noble,
     Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes,
     I purpose, is my way too. Sure, he cannot
     Be so unmanly as to leave me here.
     If he do, maids will not so easily
     Trust men again. And yet, he has not thanked me
     For what I have done - no, not so much as kissed me -
     And that, methinks, is not so well. Nor scarcely
     Could I persuade him to become a free man,
     He made such scruples of the wrong he did
     To me and to my father. Yet, I hope
     When he considers more, this love of mine
     Will take more root within him. Let him do
     What he will with me - so he use me kindly.
     For use me, so he shall, or I'll proclaim him,
     And to his face, no man. I'll presently
     Provide him necessaries and pack my clothes up,
     And where there is a patch of ground I'll venture,
     So he be with me. By him, like a shadow,
     I'll ever dwell. Within this hour the hubbub
     Will be all o'er the prison - I am then
     Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father:
     Get many more such prisoners and such daughters,
     And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him.

     (A bush in place.) Cornetts in sundry places. Noise
     and hollering as of people a-Maying.
     Enter Arcite

    ARCITE
     The Duke has lost Hippolyta - each took
     A several laund. This is a solemn rite
     They owe bloomed May, and the Athenians pay it
     To th' heart of ceremony. O, Queen Emilia,
     Fresher than May, sweeter
     Than her gold buttons on the boughs, or all
     Th'enamelled knacks o'th' mead or garden - yea,
     We challenge too the bank of any nymph
     That makes the stream seem flowers; thou, O jewel
     O'th' wood, o'th' world, hast likewise blessed a pace
     With thy sole presence in thy (
                                            ) rumination
     That I, poor man, might eftsoons come between
     And chop on some cold thought. Thrice blessäd chance
     To drop on such a mistress, expectation
     Most guiltless on't! Tell me, O Lady Fortune,
     Next after Emily my sovereign, how far
     I may be proud. She takes strong note of me,
     Hath made me near her, and this beauteous morn,
     The prim'st of all the year, presents me with
     A brace of horses - two such steeds might well
     Be by a pair of kings backed, in a field
     That their crowns' titles tried. Alas, alas,
     Poor cousin Palamon, poor prisoner - thou
     So little dream'st upon my fortune that
     Thou think'st thyself the happier thing to be
     So near Emilia. Me thou deem'st at Thebes,
     And therein wretched, although free. But if
     Thou knew'st my mistress breathed on me, and that
     I eared her language, lived in her eye - O, coz,
     What passion would enclose thee!
     Enter Palamon as out of a bush with his shackles.
     He bends his fist at Arcite

    PALAMON
     Traitor kinsman,
     Thou shouldst perceive my passion if these signs
     Of prisonment were off me, and this hand
     But owner of a sword. By all oaths in one,
     I and the justice of my love would make thee
     A confessed traitor. O thou most perfidious
     That ever gently looked, the void'st of honour
     That e'er bore gentle token, falsest cousin
     That ever blood made kin - call'st thou her thine?
     I'll prove it in my shackles, with these hands,
     Void of appointment, that thou liest and art
     A very thief in love, a chaffy lord
     Not worth the name of villain. Had I a sword
     And these house-clogs away -

    ARCITE
     Dear cousin Palamon -

    PALAMON
     Cozener Arcite, give me language such
     As thou hast showed me feat.

    ARCITE
     Not finding in
     The circuit of my breast any gross stuff
     To form me like your blazon holds me to
     This gentleness of answer - 'tis your passion
     That thus mistakes, the which, to you being enemy,
     Cannot to me be kind. Honour and honesty
     I cherish and depend on, howsoe'er
     You skip them in me, and with them, fair coz,
     I'll maintain my proceedings. Pray be pleased
     To show in generous terms your griefs, since that
     Your question's with your equal, who professes
     To clear his own way with the mind and sword
     Of a true gentleman.

    PALAMON
     That thou durst, Arcite!

    ARCITE
     My coz, my coz, you have been well advertised
     How much I dare; you've seen me use my sword
     Against th' advice of fear. Sure, of another
     You would not hear me doubted, but your silence
     Should break out, though i'th' sanctuary.

    PALAMON
     Sir,
     I have seen you move in such a place which well
     Might justify your manhood; you were called
     A good knight and a bold. But the whole week's not fair
     If any day it rain: their valiant temper
     Men lose when they incline to treachery,
     And then they fight like compelled bears - would fly
     Were they not tied.

    ARCITE
     Kinsman, you might as well
     Speak this and act it in your glass as to
     His ear which now disdains you.

    PALAMON
     Come up to me,
     Quit me of these cold gyves, give me a sword,
     Though it be rusty, and the charity
     Of one meal lend me. Come before me then,
     A good sword in thy hand, and do but say
     That Emily is thine - I will forgive
     The trespass thou hast done me, yea, my life,
     If then thou carry't; and brave souls in shades
     That have died manly, which will seek of me
     Some news from earth, they shall get none but this -
     That thou art brave and noble.

    ARCITE
     Be content,
     Again betake you to your hawthorn house.
     With counsel of the night I will be here
     With wholesome viands. These impediments
     Will I file off. You shall have garments and
     Perfumes to kill the smell o'th' prison. After,
     When you shall stretch yourself and say but 'Arcite,
     I am in plight', there shall be at your choice
     Both sword and armour.

    PALAMON
     O, you heavens, dares any
     So noble bear a guilty business! None
     But only Arcite, therefore none but Arcite
     In this kind is so bold.

    ARCITE
     Sweet Palamon.

    PALAMON
     I do embrace you and your offer - for
     Your offer do't I only, sir; your person,
     Without hypocrisy, I may not wish
     Wind horns within
     More than my sword's edge on't.

    ARCITE
     You hear the horns -
     Enter your muset lest this match between's
     Be crossed ere met. Give me your hand, farewell.
     I'll bring you every needful thing - I pray you,
     Take comfort and be strong.

    PALAMON
     Pray hold your promise,
     And do the deed with a bent brow. Most certain
     You love me not - be rough with me and pour
     This oil out of your language. By this air,
     I could for each word give a cuff, my stomach
     Not reconciled by reason.

    ARCITE
     Plainly spoken,
     Yet - pardon me - hard language: when I spur
     Wind horns within
     My horse I chide him not. Content and anger
     In me have but one face. Hark, sir, they call
     The scattered to the banquet. You must guess
     I have an office there.

    PALAMON
     Sir, your attendance
     Cannot please heaven, and I know your office
     Unjustly is achieved.

    ARCITE
     'Tis a good title.
     I am persuaded this question, sick between's,
     By bleeding must be cured. I am a suitor
     That to your sword you will bequeath this plea
     And talk of it no more.

    PALAMON
     But this one word:
     You are going now to gaze upon my mistress -
     For note you, mine she is -

    ARCITE
     Nay then -

    PALAMON
     Nay, pray you -
     You talk of feeding me to breed me strength -
     You are going now to look upon a sun
     That strengthens what it looks on. There you have
     A vantage o'er me, but enjoy it till
     I may enforce my remedy. Farewell.
     Exeunt severally, (Palamon as into the bush)

     Enter the Jailer's Daughter, with a file

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     He has mistook the brake I meant, is gone
     After his fancy. 'Tis now wellnigh morning.
     No matter - would it were perpetual night,
     And darkness lord o'th' world. Hark, 'tis a wolf!
     In me hath grief slain fear, and, but for one thing,
     I care for nothing - and that's Palamon.
     I reck not if the wolves would jaw me, so
     He had this file. What if I hollered for him?
     I cannot holler. If I whooped, what then?
     If he not answered, I should call a wolf
     And do him but that service. I have heard
     Strange howls this livelong night - why may't not be
     They have made prey of him? He has no weapons;
     He cannot run; the jangling of his gyves
     Might call fell things to listen, who have in them
     A sense to know a man unarmed, and can
     Smell where resistance is. I'll set it down
     He's torn to pieces: they howled many together
     And then they fed on him. So much for that.
     Be bold to ring the bell. How stand I then?
     All's chared when he is gone. No, no, I lie:
     My father's to be hanged for his escape,
     Myself to beg, if I prized life so much
     As to deny my act - but that I would not,
     Should I try death by dozens. I am moped -
     Food took I none these two days,
     Sipped some water. I have not closed mine eyes
     Save when my lids scoured off their brine. Alas,
     Dissolve, my life; let not my sense unsettle,
     Lest I should drown or stab or hang myself.
     O state of nature, fail together in me,
     Since thy best props are warped. So which way now?
     The best way is the next way to a grave,
     Each errant step beside is torment. Lo,
     The moon is down, the crickets chirp, the screech-owl
     Calls in the dawn. All offices are done
     Save what I fail in: but the point is this,
     An end, and that is all.
     Exit

     Enter Arcite with a bundle containing meat, wine, and files

    ARCITE
     I should be near the place. Ho, cousin Palamon!
     Enter Palamon (as from the bush)

    PALAMON
     Arcite.

    ARCITE
     The same. I have brought you food and files.
     Come forth and fear not, here's no Theseus.

    PALAMON
     Nor none so honest, Arcite.

    ARCITE
     That's no matter -
     We'll argue that hereafter. Come, take courage -
     You shall not die thus beastly. Here, sir, drink;
     I know you are faint. Then I'll talk further with you.

    PALAMON
     Arcite, thou mightst now poison me.

    ARCITE
     I might -
     But I must fear you first. Sit down and, good now,
     No more of these vain parleys. Let us not,
     Having our ancient reputation with us,
     Make talk for fools and cowards. To your health, sir.

    PALAMON
     Do.
     (Arcite drinks)

    ARCITE
     Pray sit down, then, and let me entreat you,
     By all the honesty and honour in you,
     No mention of this woman - 'twill disturb us.
     We shall have time enough.

    PALAMON
     Well, sir, I'll pledge you.
     Palamon drinks

    ARCITE
     Drink a good hearty draught; it breeds good blood, man.
     Do not you feel it thaw you?

    PALAMON
     Stay, I'll tell you
     After a draught or two more.
     Palamon drinks

    ARCITE
     Spare it not -
     The Duke has more, coz. Eat now.

    PALAMON
     Yes.
     Palamon eats

    ARCITE
     I am glad
     You have so good a stomach.

    PALAMON
     I am gladder
     I have so good meat to't.

    ARCITE
     Is't not mad, lodging
     Here in the wild woods, cousin?

    PALAMON
     Yes, for them
     That have wild consciences.

    ARCITE
     How tastes your victuals?
     Your hunger needs no sauce, I see.

    PALAMON
     Not much.
     But if it did, yours is too tart, sweet cousin.
     What is this?

    ARCITE
     Venison.

    PALAMON
     'Tis a lusty meat -
     Give me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenches
     We have known in our days. (Drinking) The lord
     steward's daughter.
     Do you remember her?

    ARCITE
     After you, coz.

    PALAMON
     She loved a black-haired man.

    ARCITE
     She did so; well, sir.

    PALAMON
     And I have heard some call him Arcite, and -

    ARCITE
     Out with't, faith.

    PALAMON
     She met him in an arbour -
     What did she there, coz? Play o'th' virginals?

    ARCITE
     Something she did, sir -

    PALAMON
     Made her groan a month for't -
     Or two, or three, or ten.

    ARCITE
     The marshal's sister
     Had her share too, as I remember, cousin,
     Else there be tales abroad. You'll pledge her?

    PALAMON
     Yes.
     (They drink)

    ARCITE
     A pretty brown wench 'tis. There was a time
     When young men went a-hunting, and a wood,
     And a broad beech, and thereby hangs a tale -
     Heigh-ho!

    PALAMON
     For Emily, upon my life! Fool,
     Away with this strained mirth. I say again,
     That sigh was breathed for Emily. Base cousin,
     Dar'st thou break first?

    ARCITE
     You are wide.

    PALAMON
     By heaven and earth,
     There's nothing in thee honest.

    ARCITE
     Then I'll leave you -
     You are a beast now.

    PALAMON
     As thou mak'st me, traitor.

    ARCITE
     (pointing to the bundle)
     There's all things needful: files and shirts and perfumes -
     I'll come again some two hours hence and bring
     That that shall quiet all.

    PALAMON
     A sword and armour.

    ARCITE
     Fear me not. You are now too foul. Farewell.
     Get off your trinkets: you shall want naught.

    PALAMON
     Sirrah -

    ARCITE
     I'll hear no more.
     Exit

    PALAMON
     If he keep touch, he dies for't.
     Exit (as into the bush)

     Enter the Jailer's Daughter

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I am very cold, and all the stars are out too,
     The little stars and all, that look like aglets -
     The sun has seen my folly. Palamon!
     Alas, no, he's in heaven. Where am I now?
     Yonder's the sea and there's a ship - how't tumbles!
     And there's a rock lies watching under water -
     Now, now, it beats upon it - now, now, now,
     There's a leak sprung, a sound one - how they cry!
     Open her before the wind - you'll lose all else.
     Up with a course or two and tack about, boys.
     Good night, good night, you're gone. I am very hungry.
     Would I could find a fine frog - he would tell me
     News from all parts o'th' world, then would I make
     A carrack of a cockle-shell, and sail
     By east and north-east to the King of Pygmies,
     For he tells fortunes rarely. Now my father,
     Twenty to one, is trussed up in a trice
     Tomorrow morning. I'll say never a word.
     (She sings)
     For I'll cut my green coat, a foot above my knee,
     And I'll clip my yellow locks, an inch below mine eye,
     Hey nonny, nonny, nonny,
     He s' buy me a white cut, forth for to ride,
     And I'll go seek him, through the world that is so wide,
     Hey nonny, nonny, nonny.
     O for a prick now, like a nightingale,
     To put my breast against. I shall sleep like a top else.

     Enter Gerald (a schoolmaster), five Countrymen, one
     of whom is dressed as a Babion, five Wenches, and
     Timothy, a taborer. All are attired as morris dancers

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Fie, fie,
     What tediosity and disinsanity
     Is here among ye! Have my rudiments
     Been laboured so long with ye, milked unto ye,
     And, by a figure, even the very plum-broth
     And marrow of my understanding laid upon ye?
     And do you still cry 'where?' and 'how?' and 'wherefore?'
     You most coarse frieze capacities, ye jean judgements,
     Have I said, 'thus let be', and 'there let be',
     And 'then let be', and no man understand me?
     Proh deum, medius fidius - ye are all dunces.
     Forwhy, here stand I. Here the Duke comes. There are you,
     Close in the thicket. The Duke appears. I meet him,
     And unto him I utter learnäd things
     And many figures. He hears, and nods, and hums,
     And then cries, 'Rare!', and I go forward. At length
     I fling my cap up - mark there - then do you,
     As once did Meleager and the boar,
     Break comely out before him, like true lovers,
     Cast yourselves in a body decently,
     And sweetly, by a figure, trace and turn, boys.

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     And sweetly we will do it, master Gerald.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     Draw up the company. Where's the taborer?

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     Why, Timothy!

    TABORER
     Here, my mad boys, have at ye!

    SCHOOLMASTER
     But I say, where's these women?

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Here's Friz and Madeline.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     And little Luce with the white legs, and bouncing Barbara.

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     And freckled Nell, that never failed her master.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Where be your ribbons, maids? Swim with your bodies
     And carry it sweetly and deliverly,
     And now and then a favour and a frisk.

    NELL
     Let us alone, sir.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Where's the rest o'th' music?

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     Dispersed as you commanded.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Couple, then,
     And see what's wanting. Where's the babion?
     (To the Babion) My friend, carry your tail without
     offence
     Or scandal to the ladies; and be sure
     You tumble with audacity and manhood,
     And when you bark, do it with judgement.

    BABION
     Yes, sir.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Quousque tandem? Here is a woman wanting!

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     We may go whistle - all the fat's i'th' fire.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     We have,
     As learnäd authors utter, washed a tile;
     We have been fatuus, and laboured vainly.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     This is that scornful piece, that scurvy hilding
     That gave her promise faithfully she would be here -
     Cicely, the seamstress' daughter.
     The next gloves that I give her shall be dogskin.
     Nay, an she fail me once - you can tell, Arcas,
     She swore by wine and bread she would not break.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     An eel and woman,
     A learnäd poet says, unless by th' tail
     And with thy teeth thou hold, will either fail -
     In manners this was false position.

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     A fire-ill take her! Does she flinch now?

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     What
     Shall we determine, sir?

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Nothing;
     Our business is become a nullity,
     Yea, and a woeful and a piteous nullity.

    FOURTH COUNTRYMAN
     Now, when the credit of our town lay on it,
     Now to be frampold, now to piss o'th' nettle!
     Go thy ways - I'll remember thee, I'll fit thee!
     Enter the Jailer's Daughter

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     (sings)
            The George Alow came from the south,
            From the coast of Barbary-a;
            And there he met with brave gallants of war,
            By one, by two, by three-a.
            'Well hailed, well hailed, you jolly gallants,
            And whither now are you bound-a?
            O let me have your company
            Till I come to the sound-a.'
     There was three fools fell out about an owlet -
            The one he said it was an owl,
            The other he said nay,
            The third he said it was a hawk,
            And her bells were cut away.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     There's a dainty madwoman, master,
     Comes i'th' nick, as mad as a March hare.
     If we can get her dance, we are made again.
     I warrant her, she'll do the rarest gambols.

    FIRST COUNTRYMAN
     A madwoman? We are made, boys.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     (to the Jailer's Daughter)
     And are you mad, good woman?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I would be sorry else.
     Give me your hand.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Why?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I can tell your fortune.
     (She examines his hand)
     You are a fool. Tell ten - I have posed him. Buzz!
     Friend, you must eat no white bread - if you do,
     Your teeth will bleed extremely. Shall we dance, ho?
     I know you - you're a tinker. Sirrah tinker,
     Stop no more holes but what you should.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Dii boni-
     A tinker, damsel?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Or a conjurer -
     Raise me a devil now and let him play
     Qui passa o'th' bells and bones.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Go, take her,
     And fluently persuade her to a peace.
     Et opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira, nec ignis -
     Strike up, and lead her in.

    SECOND COUNTRYMAN
     Come, lass, let's trip it.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I'll lead.

    THIRD COUNTRYMAN
     Do, do.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Persuasively and cunningly -
     Wind horns within
     away, boys,
     I hear the horns. Give me some meditation,
     And mark your cue.
     Exeunt all but Gerald the Schoolmaster
     Pallas inspire me.
     Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia, Arcite,
     and train

    THESEUS
     This way the stag took.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Stay and edify.

    THESEUS
     What have we here?

    PIRITHOUS
     Some country sport, upon my life, sir.

    THESEUS
     (to the Schoolmaster)
     Well, sir, go forward - we will edify.
     Ladies, sit down - we'll stay it.
     They sit: (Theseus) in a chair, the others on stools

    SCHOOLMASTER
     Thou doughty Duke, all hail! All hail, sweet ladies.

    THESEUS
     This is a cold beginning.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     If you but favour, our country pastime made is.
     We are a few of those collected here,
     That ruder tongues distinguish 'villager';
     And to say verity, and not to fable,
     We are a merry rout, or else a rabble,
     Or company, or, by a figure, chorus,
     That fore thy dignity will dance a morris.
     And I, that am the rectifier of all,
     By title pedagogus, that let fall
     The birch upon the breeches of the small ones,
     And humble with a ferula the tall ones,
     Do here present this machine, or this frame;
     And dainty Duke, whose doughty dismal fame
     From Dis to Daedalus, from post to pillar,
     Is blown abroad, help me, thy poor well-willer,
     And with thy twinkling eyes, look right and straight
     Upon this mighty 'Moor' - of mickle weight -
     'Ice' now comes in, which, being glued together,
     Makes 'morris', and the cause that we came hither.
     The body of our sport, of no small study,
     I first appear, though rude, and raw, and muddy,
     To speak, before thy noble grace, this tenor
     At whose great feet I offer up my penner.
     The next, the Lord of May and Lady bright;
     The Chambermaid and Servingman, by night
     That seek out silent hanging; then mine Host
     And his fat Spouse, that welcomes, to their cost,
     The galläd traveller, and with a beck'ning
     Informs the tapster to inflame the reck'ning;
     Then the beest-eating Clown; and next, the Fool;
     The babion with long tail and eke long tool,
     Cum multis aliis that make a dance -
     Say 'ay', and all shall presently advance.

    THESEUS
     Ay, ay, by any means, dear dominie.

    PIRITHOUS
     Produce.

    SCHOOLMASTER
     (knocks for the dance)
     Intrate filii, come forth and foot it.
     (He flings up his cap.) Music.
     (The Schoolmaster ushers in
          May Lord,         May Lady.
          Servingman,       Chambermaid.
          A Country Clown,

          An Host,          Hostess.
          A He-babion,      She-babion.

                             She-fool.
     All these persons apparelled to the life, the men
     issuing out of one door and the wenches from the
     other. They dance a morris)
            Ladies, if we have been merry,
            And have pleased ye with a derry,
            And a derry, and a down,
            Say the schoolmaster's no clown.
            Duke, if we have pleased thee too,
            And have done as good boys should do,
            Give us but a tree or twain
            For a maypole, and again,
            Ere another year run out,
            We'll make thee laugh, and all this rout.

    THESEUS
     Take twenty, dominie. (To Hippolyta) How does my
     sweetheart?

    HIPPOLYTA
     Never so pleased, sir.

    EMILIA
     'Twas an excellent dance,
     And for a preface, I never heard a better.

    THESEUS
     Schoolmaster, I thank you. One see 'em all rewarded.

    PIRITHOUS
     And here's something to paint your pole withal.
     He gives them money

    THESEUS
     Now to our sports again.

    SCHOOLMASTER
        May the stag thou hunt'st stand long,
        And thy dogs be swift and strong;
        May they kill him without lets,
        And the ladies eat his dowsets.
     Exeunt Theseus and train. Wind horns within
     Come, we are all made. Dii deaeque omnes,
     Ye have danced rarely, wenches.
     Exeunt

 3.6 Scene 6
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter Palamon from the bush

    PALAMON
     About this hour my cousin gave his faith
     To visit me again, and with him bring
     Two swords and two good armours; if he fail,
     He's neither man nor soldier. When he left me,
     I did not think a week could have restored
     My lost strength to me, I was grown so low
     And crest-fall'n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,
     Thou art yet a fair foe, and I feel myself,
     With this refreshing, able once again
     To out-dure danger. To delay it longer
     Would make the world think, when it comes to hearing,
     That I lay fatting, like a swine, to fight,
     And not a soldier. Therefore this blest morning
     Shall be the last; and that sword he refuses,
     If it but hold, I kill him with; 'tis justice.
     So, love and fortune for me!
     Enter Arcite with two armours and two swords
     O, good morrow.

    ARCITE
     Good morrow, noble kinsman.

    PALAMON
     I have put you
     To too much pains, sir.

    ARCITE
     That too much, fair cousin,
     Is but a debt to honour, and my duty.

    PALAMON
     Would you were so in all, sir - I could wish ye
     As kind a kinsman, as you force me find
     A beneficial foe, that my embraces
     Might thank ye, not my blows.

    ARCITE
     I shall think either,
     Well done, a noble recompense.

    PALAMON
     Then I shall quit you.

    ARCITE
     Defy me in these fair terms, and you show
     More than a mistress to me - no more anger,
     As you love anything that's honourable.
     We were not bred to talk, man. When we are armed
     And both upon our guards, then let our fury,
     Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us;
     And then to whom the birthright of this beauty
     Truly pertains - without upbraidings, scorns,
     Despisings of our persons, and such poutings
     Fitter for girls and schoolboys - will be seen,
     And quickly, yours or mine. Will't please you arm, sir?
     Or, if you feel yourself not fitting yet,
     And furnished with your old strength, I'll stay, cousin,
     And every day discourse you into health,
     As I am spared. Your person I am friends with,
     And I could wish I had not said I loved her,
     Though I had died; but loving such a lady,
     And justifying my love, I must not fly from't.

    PALAMON
     Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy
     That no man but thy cousin's fit to kill thee.
     I am well and lusty - choose your arms.

    ARCITE
     Choose you, sir.

    PALAMON
     Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it
     To make me spare thee?

    ARCITE
     If you think so, cousin,
     You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,
     I will not spare you.

    PALAMON
     That's well said.

    ARCITE
     You'll find it.

    PALAMON
     Then as I am an honest man, and love
     With all the justice of affection,
     I'll pay thee soundly.
     He chooses one armour
     This I'll take.

    ARCITE
     (indicating the remaining armour)
     That's mine, then.
     I'll arm you first.

    PALAMON
     Do.
     Arcite arms Palamon
     Pray thee tell me, cousin,
     Where gott'st thou this good armour?

    ARCITE
     'Tis the Duke's,
     And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?

    PALAMON
     No.

    ARCITE
     Is't not too heavy?

    PALAMON
     I have worn a lighter -
     But I shall make it serve.

    ARCITE
     I'll buckle't close.

    PALAMON
     By any means.

    ARCITE
     You care not for a grand guard?

    PALAMON
     No, no, we'll use no horses. I perceive
     You would fain be at that fight.

    ARCITE
     I am indifferent.

    PALAMON
     Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle
     Through far enough.

    ARCITE
     I warrant you.

    PALAMON
     My casque now.

    ARCITE
     Will you fight bare-armed?

    PALAMON
     We shall be the nimbler.

    ARCITE
     But use your gauntlets, though - those are o'th' least.
     Prithee take mine, good cousin.

    PALAMON
     Thank you, Arcite.
     How do I look? Am I fall'n much away?

    ARCITE
     Faith, very little - love has used you kindly.

    PALAMON
     I'll warrant thee, I'll strike home.

    ARCITE
     Do, and spare not -
     I'll give you cause, sweet cousin.

    PALAMON
     Now to you, sir.
     Palamon arms Arcite
     Methinks this armour's very like that, Arcite,
     Thou wor'st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.

    ARCITE
     That was a very good one, and that day,
     I well remember, you outdid me, cousin.
     I never saw such valour. When you charged
     Upon the left wing of the enemy,
     I spurred hard to come up, and under me
     I had a right good horse.

    PALAMON
     You had indeed -
     A bright bay, I remember.

    ARCITE
     Yes. But all
     Was vainly laboured in me - you outwent me,
     Nor could my wishes reach you. Yet a little
     I did by imitation.

    PALAMON
     More by virtue -
     You are modest, cousin.

    ARCITE
     When I saw you charge first,
     Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder
     Break from the troop.

    PALAMON
     But still before that flew
     The lightning of your valour. Stay a little,
     Is not this piece too strait?

    ARCITE
     No, no, 'tis well.

    PALAMON
     I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword -
     A bruise would be dishonour.

    ARCITE
     Now I am perfect.

    PALAMON
     Stand off, then.

    ARCITE
     Take my sword; I hold it better.

    PALAMON
     I thank ye. No, keep it - your life lies on it.
     Here's one - if it but hold, I ask no more
     For all my hopes. My cause and honour guard me.

    ARCITE
     And me, my love.
     They bow several ways, then advance and stand
     Is there aught else to say?

    PALAMON
     This only, and no more. Thou art mine aunt's son,
     And that blood we desire to shed is mutual:
     In me, thine, and in thee, mine. My sword
     Is in my hand, and if thou kill'st me,
     The gods and I forgive thee. If there be
     A place prepared for those that sleep in honour,
     I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.
     Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.

    ARCITE
     Here, Palamon. This hand shall never more
     Come near thee with such friendship.

    PALAMON
     I commend thee.

    ARCITE
     If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward -
     For none but such dare die in these just trials.
     Once more farewell, my cousin.

    PALAMON
     Farewell, Arcite.
     Fight. Horns within; they stand

    ARCITE
     Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us.

    PALAMON
     Why?

    ARCITE
     This is the Duke a-hunting, as I told you.
     If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire,
     For honour's sake, and safely, presently,
     Into your bush again. Sir, we shall find
     Too many hours to die. In, gentle cousin -
     If you be seen, you perish instantly
     For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,
     For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,
     And say we had a noble difference,
     But base disposers of it.

    PALAMON
     No, no, cousin,
     I will no more be hidden, nor put off
     This great adventure to a second trial.
     I know your cunning and I know your cause -
     He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself
     Upon thy present guard -

    ARCITE
     You are not mad?

    PALAMON
     Or I will make th' advantage of this hour
     Mine own, and what to come shall threaten me
     I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,
     I love Emilia, and in that I'll bury
     Thee and all crosses else.

    ARCITE
     Then come what can come,
     Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well
     Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me,
     The law will have the honour of our ends.
     Have at thy life!

    PALAMON
     Look to thine own well, Arcite!
     They fight again.
     Horns. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous,
     and train. (Theseus) separates Palamon and Arcite

    THESEUS
     What ignorant and mad malicious traitors
     Are you, that 'gainst the tenor of my laws
     Are making battle, thus like knights appointed,
     Without my leave and officers of arms?
     By Castor, both shall die.

    PALAMON
     Hold thy word, Theseus.
     We are certainly both traitors, both despisers
     Of thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,
     That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison -
     Think well what that deserves. And this is Arcite;
     A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,
     A falser ne'er seemed friend. This is the man
     Was begged and banished; this is he contemns thee,
     And what thou dar'st do; and in this disguise,
     Against thine own edict, follows thy sister,
     That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,
     Whose servant - if there be a right in seeing
     And first bequeathing of the soul to - justly
     I am; and, which is more, dares think her his.
     This treachery, like a most trusty lover,
     I called him now to answer. If thou be'st
     As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,
     The true decider of all injuries,
     Say, 'Fight again', and thou shalt see me, Theseus,
     Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.
     Then take my life - I'll woo thee to't.

    PIRITHOUS
     O heaven,
     What more than man is this!

    THESEUS
     I have sworn.

    ARCITE
     We seek not
     Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. 'Tis to me
     A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,
     And no more moved. Where this man calls me traitor
     Let me say thus much - if in love be treason,
     In service of so excellent a beauty,
     As I love most, and in that faith will perish,
     As I have brought my life here to confirm it,
     As I have served her truest, worthiest,
     As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,
     So let me be most traitor and ye please me.
     For scorning thy edict, Duke, ask that lady
     Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me
     Stay here to love her, and if she say, 'Traitor',
     I am a villain fit to lie unburied.

    PALAMON
     Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,
     If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,
     As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;
     As thou art valiant, for thy cousin's soul,
     Whose twelve strong labours crown his memory,
     Let's die together, at one instant, Duke.
     Only a little let him fall before me,
     That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.

    THESEUS
     I grant your wish; for to say true, your cousin
     Has ten times more offended, for I gave him
     More mercy than you found, sir, your offences
     Being no more than his. None here speak for 'em,
     For ere the sun set both shall sleep for ever.

    HIPPOLYTA
     (to Emilia)
     Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,
     Speak, not to be denied. That face of yours
     Will bear the curses else of after ages
     For these lost cousins.

    EMILIA
     In my face, dear sister,
     I find no anger to 'em, nor no ruin.
     The misadventure of their own eyes kill 'em.
     Yet that I will be woman and have pity,
     (She kneels)
     My knees shall grow to th' ground, but I'll get mercy.
     Help me, dear sister - in a deed so virtuous
     The powers of all women will be with us.
     Hippolyta kneels
     Most royal brother -

    HIPPOLYTA
     Sir, by our tie of marriage -

    EMILIA
     By your own spotless honour -

    HIPPOLYTA
     By that faith,
     That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me -

    EMILIA
     By that you would have pity in another,
     By your own virtues infinite -

    HIPPOLYTA
     By valour,
     By all the chaste nights I have ever pleased you -

    THESEUS
     These are strange conjurings.

    PIRITHOUS
     Nay, then, I'll in too.
     (He kneels)
     By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,
     By all you love most: wars, and this sweet lady -

    EMILIA
     By that you would have trembled to deny
     A blushing maid -

    HIPPOLYTA
     By your own eyes, by strength -
     In which you swore I went beyond all women,
     Almost all men - and yet I yielded, Theseus -

    PIRITHOUS
     To crown all this, by your most noble soul,
     Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first -

    HIPPOLYTA
     Next hear my prayers -

    EMILIA
     Last let me entreat, sir -

    PIRITHOUS
     For mercy.

    HIPPOLYTA
     Mercy.

    EMILIA
     Mercy on these princes.

    THESEUS
     Ye make my faith reel. Say I felt
     Compassion to 'em both, how would you place it?
     (They rise)

    EMILIA
     Upon their lives - but with their banishments.

    THESEUS
     You are a right woman, sister: you have pity,
     But want the understanding where to use it.
     If you desire their lives, invent a way
     Safer than banishment. Can these two live,
     And have the agony of love about 'em,
     And not kill one another? Every day
     They'd fight about you, hourly bring your honour
     In public question with their swords. Be wise, then,
     And here forget 'em. It concerns your credit
     And my oath equally. I have said - they die.
     Better they fall by th' law than one another.
     Bow not my honour.

    EMILIA
     O my noble brother,
     That oath was rashly made, and in your anger.
     Your reason will not hold it. If such vows
     Stand for express will, all the world must perish.
     Beside, I have another oath 'gainst yours,
     Of more authority, I am sure more love -
     Not made in passion, neither, but good heed.

    THESEUS
     What is it, sister?

    PIRITHOUS
     (to Emilia)
     Urge it home, brave lady.

    EMILIA
     That you would ne'er deny me anything
     Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.
     I tie you to your word now; if ye fail in't,
     Think how you maim your honour -
     For now I am set a-begging, sir. I am deaf
     To all but your compassion - how their lives
     Might breed the ruin of my name, opinion.
     Shall anything that loves me perish for me?
     That were a cruel wisdom: do men prune
     The straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms
     Because they may be rotten? O, Duke Theseus,
     The goodly mothers that have groaned for these,
     And all the longing maids that ever loved,
     If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,
     And in their funeral songs for these two cousins
     Despise my cruelty and cry woe worth me,
     Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.
     For heaven's sake, save their lives and banish 'em.

    THESEUS
     On what conditions?

    EMILIA
     Swear 'em never more
     To make me their contention, or to know me,
     To tread upon thy dukedom; and to be,
     Wherever they shall travel, ever strangers
     To one another.

    PALAMON
     I'll be cut a-pieces
     Before I take this oath - forget I love her?
     O all ye gods, despise me, then. Thy banishment
     I not mislike, so we may fairly carry
     Our swords and cause along - else, never trifle,
     But take our lives, Duke. I must love, and will;
     And for that love must and dare kill this cousin
     On any piece the earth has.

    THESEUS
     Will you, Arcite,
     Take these conditions?

    PALAMON
     He's a villain then.

    PIRITHOUS
     These are men!

    ARCITE
     No, never, Duke. 'Tis worse to me than begging,
     To take my life so basely. Though I think
     I never shall enjoy her, yet I'll preserve
     The honour of affection and die for her,
     Make death a devil.

    THESEUS
     What may be done? For now I feel compassion.

    PIRITHOUS
     Let it not fall again, sir.

    THESEUS
     Say, Emilia,
     If one of them were dead - as one must - are you
     Content to take the other to your husband?
     They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes
     As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble
     As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon 'em,
     And if you can love, end this difference.
     I give consent. (To Palamon and Arcite) Are you
     content too, princes?

    PALAMON AND ARCITE
     With all our souls.

    THESEUS
     He that she refuses
     Must die, then.

    PALAMON AND ARCITE
     Any death thou canst invent, Duke.

    PALAMON
     If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favour,
     And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.

    ARCITE
     If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,
     And soldiers sing my epitaph.

    THESEUS
     (to Emilia)
     Make choice, then.

    EMILIA
     I cannot, sir. They are both too excellent.
     For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.

    HIPPOLYTA
     (to Theseus)
     What will become of 'em?

    THESEUS
     Thus I ordain it,
     And by mine honour once again it stands,
     Or both shall die. (To Palamon and Arcite) You shall
     both to your country,
     And each within this month, accompanied
     With three fair knights, appear again in this place,
     In which I'll plant a pyramid; and whether,
     Before us that are here, can force his cousin,
     By fair and knightly strength, to touch the pillar,
     He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,
     And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,
     Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.
     Will this content ye?

    PALAMON
     Yes. Here, cousin Arcite,
     I am friends again till that hour.

    ARCITE
     I embrace ye.

    THESEUS
     (to Emilia)
     Are you content, sister?

    EMILIA
     Yes, I must, sir,
     Else both miscarry.

    THESEUS
     (to Palamon and Arcite)
     Come, shake hands again, then,
     And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel
     Sleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course.

    PALAMON
     We dare not fail thee, Theseus.

    THESEUS
     Come, I'll give ye
     Now usage like to princes and to friends.
     When ye return, who wins I'll settle here,
     Who loses, yet I'll weep upon his bier.
     Exeunt. (In the act-time the bush is removed)

     Concerning the escape of Palamon?
     Good sir, remember.

    FRIEND
     Nothing that I heard,
     For I came home before the business
     Was fully ended. Yet I might perceive,
     Ere I departed, a great likelihood
     Of both their pardons: for Hippolyta
     And fair-eyed Emily upon their knees
     Begged with such handsome pity that the Duke,
     Methought, stood staggering whether he should follow
     His rash oath or the sweet compassion
     Of those two ladies; and to second them
     That truly noble prince, Pirithous -
     Half his own heart - set in too, that I hope
     All shall be well. Neither heard I one question
     Of your name or his scape.
     Enter the Second Friend

    JAILER
     Pray heaven it hold so.

    SECOND FRIEND
     Be of good comfort, man. I bring you news,
     Good news.

    JAILER
     They are welcome.

    SECOND FRIEND
     Palamon has cleared you,
     And got your pardon, and discovered how
     And by whose means he scaped - which was your daughter's,
     Whose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner,
     Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,
     Has given a sum of money to her marriage -
     A large one, I'll assure you.

    JAILER
     Ye are a good man,
     And ever bring good news.

    FIRST FRIEND
     How was it ended?

    SECOND FRIEND
     Why, as it should be: they that ne'er begged,
     But they prevailed, had their suits fairly granted -
     The prisoners have their lives.

    FIRST FRIEND
     I knew 'twould be so.

    SECOND FRIEND
     But there be new conditions which you'll hear of
     At better time.

    JAILER
     I hope they are good.

    SECOND FRIEND
     They are honourable -
     How good they'll prove I know not.
     Enter the Wooer

    FIRST FRIEND
     'Twill be known.

    WOOER
     Alas, sir, where's your daughter?

    JAILER
     Why do you ask?

    WOOER
     O, sir, when did you see her?

    SECOND FRIEND
     How he looks!

    JAILER
     This morning.

    WOOER
     Was she well? Was she in health?
     Sir, when did she sleep?

    FIRST FRIEND
     These are strange questions.

    JAILER
     I do not think she was very well: for now
     You make me mind her, but this very day
     I asked her questions and she answered me
     So far from what she was, so childishly,
     So sillily, as if she were a fool,
     An innocent - and I was very angry.
     But what of her, sir?

    WOOER
     Nothing, but my pity -
     But you must know it, and as good by me
     As by another that less loves her -

    JAILER
     Well, sir?

    FIRST FRIEND
     Not right?

    WOOER
     No, sir, not well.

    SECOND FRIEND
     Not well?

    WOOER
     'Tis too true - she is mad.

    FIRST FRIEND
     It cannot be.

    WOOER
     Believe, you'll find it so.

    JAILER
     I half suspected
     What you told me - the gods comfort her!
     Either this was her love to Palamon,
     Or fear of my miscarrying on his scape,
     Or both.

    WOOER
     'Tis likely.

    JAILER
     But why all this haste, sir?

    WOOER
     I'll tell you quickly. As I late was angling
     In the great lake that lies behind the palace,
     From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,
     As patiently I was attending sport,
     I heard a voice - a shrill one - and attentive
     I gave my ear, when I might well perceive
     'Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it
     A boy or woman. I then left my angle
     To his own skill, came near, but yet perceived not
     Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds
     Had so encompassed it. I laid me down
     And listened to the words she sung, for then,
     Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,
     I saw it was your daughter.

    JAILER
     Pray go on, sir.

    WOOER
     She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her
     Repeat this often - 'Palamon is gone,
     Is gone to th' wood to gather mulberries;
     I'll find him out tomorrow.'

    FIRST FRIEND
     Pretty soul!

    WOOER
     'His shackles will betray him - he'll be taken,
     And what shall I do then? I'll bring a bevy,
     A hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do,
     With chaplets on their heads of daffodillies,
     With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,
     And all we'll dance an antic fore the Duke
     And beg his pardon.' Then she talked of you, sir -
     That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,
     And she must gather flowers to bury you,
     And see the house made handsome. Then she sung
     Nothing but 'willow, willow, willow', and between
     Ever was 'Palamon, fair Palamon',
     And 'Palamon was a tall young man'. The place
     Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses
     A wreath of bull-rush rounded; about her stuck
     Thousand freshwater flowers of several colours -
     That she appeared, methought, like the fair nymph
     That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris
     Newly dropped down from heaven. Rings she made
     Of rushes that grew by, and to 'em spoke
     The prettiest posies - 'Thus our true love's tied',
     'This you may lose, not me', and many a one.
     And then she wept, and sung again, and sighed -
     And with the same breath smiled and kissed her hand.

    SECOND FRIEND
     Alas, what pity it is!

    WOOER
     I made in to her:
     She saw me and straight sought the flood - I saved her,
     And set her safe to land, when presently
     She slipped away and to the city made,
     With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,
     She left me far behind her. Three or four
     I saw from far off cross her - one of 'em
     I knew to be your brother, where she stayed
     And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her,
     Enter the Jailer's Brother, the Jailer's Daughter, and others
     And hither came to tell you - here they are.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     (sings)
     'May you never more enjoy the light . . .' -
     Is not this a fine song?

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     O, a very fine one.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I can sing twenty more.

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     I think you can.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Yes, truly can I - I can sing 'The Broom'
     And 'Bonny Robin' - are not you a tailor?

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     Yes.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Where's my wedding gown?

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     I'll bring it tomorrow.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Do, very rarely - I must be abroad else,
     To call the maids and pay the minstrels,
     For I must lose my maidenhead by cocklight,
     'Twill never thrive else. (Sings)'O fair, O sweet . . .'

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     (to the Jailer)
     You must e'en take it patiently.

    JAILER
     'Tis true.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Good ev'n, good men. Pray, did you ever hear
     Of one young Palamon?

    JAILER
     Yes, wench, we know him.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Is't not a fine young gentleman?

    JAILER
     'Tis, love.

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     By no mean cross her, she is then distempered
     Far worse than now she shows.

    FIRST FRIEND
     (to the Jailer's Daughter)
     Yes, he's a fine man.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     O, is he so? You have a sister.

    FIRST FRIEND
     Yes.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     But she shall never have him, tell her so,
     For a trick that I know. You'd best look to her,
     For if she see him once, she's gone - she's done
     And undone in an hour. All the young maids
     Of our town are in love with him, but I laugh at 'em
     And let 'em all alone. Is 't not a wise course?

    FIRST FRIEND
     Yes.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     There is at least two hundred now with child by him,
     There must be four; yet I keep close for all this,
     Close as a cockle; and all these must be boys -
     He has the trick on't - and at ten years old
     They must be all gelt for musicians
     And sing the wars of Theseus.

    SECOND FRIEND
     This is strange.

    (JAILER'S BROTHER)
     As ever you heard, but say nothing.

    FIRST FRIEND
     No.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     They come from all parts of the dukedom to him.
     I'll warrant ye, he had not so few last night
     As twenty to dispatch. He'll tickle't up
     In two hours, if his hand be in.

    JAILER
     She's lost
     Past all cure.

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     Heaven forbid, man!

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     (to the Jailer)
     Come hither - you are a wise man.

    FIRST FRIEND
     Does she know him?

    SECOND FRIEND
     No - would she did.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     You are master of a ship?

    JAILER
     Yes.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Where's your compass?

    JAILER
     Here.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Set it to th' north.
     And now direct your course to th' wood where Palamon
     Lies longing for me. For the tackling,
     Let me alone. Come, weigh, my hearts, cheerly all.
     Uff, uff, uff! 'Tis up. The wind's fair. Top the bowline.
     Out with the mainsail. Where's your whistle, master?

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     Let's get her in.

    JAILER
     Up to the top, boy!

    JAILER'S BROTHER
     Where's the pilot?

    FIRST FRIEND
     Here.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     What kenn'st thou?

    SECOND FRIEND
     A fair wood.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Bear for it, master.
     Tack about!
     (Sings)

 4.2 Scene 2
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     (Enter Emilia, with two pictures)

    EMILIA
     Yet I may bind those wounds up that must open
     And bleed to death for my sake else - I'll choose,
     And end their strife. Two such young handsome men
     Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers
     Following the dead cold ashes of their sons,
     Shall never curse my cruelty. Good heaven,
     What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise nature,
     With all her best endowments, all those beauties
     She sows into the births of noble bodies,
     Were here a mortal woman and had in her
     The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless
     She would run mad for this man. What an eye,
     Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness
     Has this young prince! Here love himself sits smiling!
     Just such another wanton Ganymede
     Set Jove afire once, and enforced the god
     Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,
     A shining constellation. What a brow,
     Of what a spacious majesty, he carries!
     Arched like the great-eyed Juno's, but far sweeter,
     Smoother than Pelops' shoulder! Fame and honour,
     Methinks, from hence, as from a promontory
     Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing
     To all the under world the loves and fights
     Of gods, and such men near 'em. Palamon
     Is but his foil; to him a mere dull shadow;
     He's swart and meagre, of an eye as heavy
     As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,
     No stirring in him, no alacrity,
     Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.
     Yet these that we count errors may become him:
     Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.
     O, who can find the bent of woman's fancy?
     I am a fool, my reason is lost in me,
     I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly
     That women ought to beat me. On my knees
     I ask thy pardon, Palamon, thou art alone
     And only beautiful, and these the eyes,
     These the bright lamps of beauty, that command
     And threaten love - and what young maid dare cross 'em?
     What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,
     Has this brown manly face? O, love, this only
     From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,
     Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,
     And this the noble body. I am sotted,
     Utterly lost - my virgin's faith has fled me.
     For if my brother, but even now, had asked me
     Whether I loved, I had run mad for Arcite;
     Now if my sister, more for Palamon.
     Stand both together. Now come ask me, brother -
     Alas, I know not; ask me now, sweet sister -
     I may go look. What a mere child is fancy,
     That having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,
     Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both!
     (Enter a Gentleman)
     How now, sir?

    GENTLEMAN
     From the noble Duke your brother,
     Madam, I bring you news. The knights are come.

    EMILIA
     To end the quarrel?

    GENTLEMAN
     Yes.

    EMILIA
     Would I might end first!
     What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,
     That my unspotted youth must now be soiled
     With blood of princes, and my chastity
     Be made the altar where the lives of lovers -
     Two greater and two better never yet
     Made mothers joy - must be the sacrifice
     To my unhappy beauty?
     Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, and attendants

    THESEUS
     Bring 'em in
     Quickly, by any means, I long to see 'em.
     Exit one or more
     (To Emilia) Your two contending lovers are returned,
     And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair sister,
     You must love one of them.

    EMILIA
     I had rather both,
     So neither for my sake should fall untimely.
     Enter a Messenger

    THESEUS
     Who saw 'em?

    PIRITHOUS
     I a while.

    GENTLEMAN
     And I.

    THESEUS
     (to the Messenger)
     From whence come you, sir?

    MESSENGER
     From the knights.

    THESEUS
     Pray speak,
     You that have seen them, what they are.

    MESSENGER
     I will, sir,
     And truly what I think. Six braver spirits
     Than these they have brought, if we judge by the outside,
     I never saw nor read of. He that stands
     In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming,
     Should be a stout man; by his face, a prince.
     His very looks so say him: his complexion,
     Nearer a brown than black, stern and yet noble,
     Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.
     The circles of his eyes show fire within him,
     And, as a heated lion, so he looks.
     His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining,
     Like ravens' wings. His shoulders, broad and strong;
     Armed long and round; and on his thigh a sword
     Hung by a curious baldric, when he frowns
     To seal his will with. Better, o' my conscience,
     Was never soldier's friend.

    THESEUS
     Thou hast well described him.

    PIRITHOUS
     Yet a great deal short,
     Methinks, of him that's first with Palamon.

    THESEUS
     Pray speak him, friend.

    PIRITHOUS
     I guess he is a prince too,
     And, if it may be, greater - for his show
     Has all the ornament of honour in't.
     He's somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,
     But of a face far sweeter. His complexion
     Is as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt,
     Without doubt, what he fights for, and so apter
     To make this cause his own. In's face appears
     All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,
     And when he's angry, then a settled valour,
     Not tainted with extremes, runs through his body
     And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot -
     He shows no such soft temper. His head's yellow,
     Hard-haired and curled, thick twined: like ivy tods,
     Not to undo with thunder. In his face
     The livery of the warlike maid appears,
     Pure red and white - for yet no beard has blessed him -
     And in his rolling eyes sits victory,
     As if she ever meant to court his valour.
     His nose stands high, a character of honour;
     His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.

    EMILIA
     Must these men die too?

    PIRITHOUS
     When he speaks, his tongue
     Sounds like a trumpet. All his lineaments
     Are as a man would wish 'em - strong and clean.
     He wears a well-steeled axe, the staff of gold.
     His age, some five-and-twenty.

    MESSENGER
     There's another -
     A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming
     As great as any. Fairer promises
     In such a body yet I never looked on.

    PIRITHOUS
     O, he that's freckle-faced?

    MESSENGER
     The same, my lord.
     Are they not sweet ones?

    PIRITHOUS
     Yes, they are well.

    MESSENGER
     Methinks,
     Being so few and well disposed, they show
     Great and fine art in nature. He's white-haired -
     Not wanton white, but such a manly colour
     Next to an auburn, tough and nimble set,
     Which shows an active soul. His arms are brawny,
     Lined with strong sinews - to the shoulder piece
     Gently they swell, like women new-conceived,
     Which speaks him prone to labour, never fainting
     Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,
     But when he stirs, a tiger. He's grey-eyed,
     Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp
     To spy advantages, and where he finds 'em,
     He's swift to make 'em his. He does no wrongs,
     Nor takes none. He's round-faced, and when he smiles
     He shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier.
     About his head he wears the winner's oak,
     And in it stuck the favour of his lady.
     His age, some six-and-thirty. In his hand
     He bears a charging staff embossed with silver.

    THESEUS
     Are they all thus?

    PIRITHOUS
     They are all the sons of honour.

    THESEUS
     Now as I have a soul, I long to see 'em.
     (To Hippolyta) Lady, you shall see men fight now.

    HIPPOLYTA
     I wish it,
     But not the cause, my lord. They would show
     Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms -
     'Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.
     (To Emilia) O my soft-hearted sister, what think you?
     Weep not till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.

    THESEUS
     (to Emilia)
     You have steeled 'em with your beauty.
     (To Pirithous) Honoured friend,
     To you I give the field: pray order it
     Fitting the persons that must use it.

    PIRITHOUS
     Yes, sir.

    THESEUS
     Come, I'll go visit 'em - I cannot stay,
     Their fame has fired me so. Till they appear,
     Good friend, be royal.

    PIRITHOUS
     There shall want no bravery.

    EMILIA
     (aside)
     Poor wench, go weep - for whosoever wins
     Loses a noble cousin for thy sins.
     Exeunt

 4.3 Scene 3
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter the Jailer, the Wooer, and the Doctor

    DOCTOR
     Her distraction is more at some time of the moon
     than at other some, is it not?

    JAILER
     She is continually in a harmless distemper: sleeps
     little; altogether without appetite, save often drinking;
     dreaming of another world, and a better; and what
     broken piece of matter soe'er she's about, the name
     'Palamon' lards it, that she farces every business
     Enter the Jailer's Daughter
     withal, fits it to every question. Look where she comes -
     you shall perceive her behaviour.
     They stand apart

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I have forgot it quite - the burden on't
     was 'Down-a, down-a', and penned by no worse man
     than Giraldo, Emilia's schoolmaster. He's as fantastical,
     too, as ever he may go upon's legs - for in the next
     world will Dido see Palamon, and then will she be out
     of love with Aeneas.

    DOCTOR
     What stuff's here? Poor soul.

    JAILER
     E'en thus all day long.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Now for this charm that I told you
     of - you must bring a piece of silver on the tip of your
     tongue, or no ferry: then, if it be your chance to come
     where the blessed spirits are - there's a sight now! We
     maids that have our livers perished, cracked to pieces
     with love, we shall come there and do nothing all day
     long but pick flowers with Proserpine. Then will I make
     Palamon a nosegay, then let him mark me, then -

    DOCTOR
     How prettily she's amiss! Note her a little further.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Faith, I'll tell you: sometime we go to
     barley-break, we of the blessed. Alas, 'tis a sore life
     they have i'th' other place - such burning, frying,
     boiling, hissing, howling, chattering, cursing - O they
     have shrewd measure - take heed! If one be mad or
     hang or drown themselves, thither they go, Jupiter
     bless us, and there shall we be put in a cauldron of
     lead and usurers' grease, amongst a whole million of
     cutpurses, and there boil like a gammon of bacon that
     will never be enough.

    DOCTOR
     How her brain coins!

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Lords and courtiers that have got
     maids with child - they are in this place. They shall
     stand in fire up to the navel and in ice up to th' heart,
     and there th' offending part burns, and the deceiving
     part freezes - in truth a very grievous punishment as
     one would think for such a trifle. Believe me, one would
     marry a leprous witch to be rid on't, I'll assure you.

    DOCTOR
     How she continues this fancy! 'Tis not an
     engrafted madness, but a most thick and profound
     melancholy.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     To hear there a proud lady and a
     proud city wife howl together! I were a beast an I'd
     call it good sport. One cries, 'O this smoke!', th' other,
     'This fire!'; one cries, 'O that ever I did it behind the
     arras!', and then howls - th' other curses a suing fellow
     and her garden-house.
     (Sings)
     'I will be true, my stars, my fate . . .'
     Exit Daughter

    JAILER
     (to the Doctor)
     What think you of her, sir?

    DOCTOR
     I think she has a perturbed mind, which I cannot
     minister to.

    JAILER
     Alas, what then?

    DOCTOR
     Understand you she ever affected any man ere
     she beheld Palamon?

    JAILER
     I was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed her
     liking on this gentleman, my friend.

    WOOER
     I did think so too, and would account I had a
     great penn'orth on't to give half my state that both
     she and I, at this present, stood unfeignedly on the
     same terms.

    DOCTOR
     That intemperate surfeit of her eye hath distempered
     the other senses. They may return and settle
     again to execute their preordained faculties, but they
     are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must
     do: confine her to a place where the light may rather
     seem to steal in than be permitted; take upon you,
     young sir her friend, the name of Palamon; say you
     come to eat with her and to commune of love. This
     will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon -
     other objects that are inserted 'tween her mind and
     eye become the pranks and friskins of her madness.
     Sing to her such green songs of love as she says
     Palamon hath sung in prison; come to her stuck in as
     sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto
     make an addition of some other compounded odours
     which are grateful to the sense. All this shall become
     Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet
     and every good thing. Desire to eat with her, carve
     her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your
     petition of grace and acceptance into her favour. Learn
     what maids have been her companions and playferes,
     and let them repair to her, with Palamon in their
     mouths, and appear with tokens as if they suggested
     for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with
     falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat,
     to sleep, and reduce what's now out of square in her
     into their former law and regiment. I have seen it
     approved, how many times I know not, but to make
     the number more I have great hope in this. I will
     between the passages of this project come in with my
     appliance. Let us put it in execution, and hasten the
     success, which doubt not will bring forth comfort.

 5.1 Scene 1
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     (An altar prepared.) Flourish. Enter Theseus,
     Pirithous, Hippolyta, attendants

    THESEUS
     Now let 'em enter and before the gods
     Tender their holy prayers. Let the temples
     Burn bright with sacred fires, and the altars
     In hallowed clouds commend their swelling incense
     To those above us. Let no due be wanting.
     Flourish of cornetts
     They have a noble work in hand, will honour
     The very powers that love 'em.
     Enter Palamon with his three Knights (at
     one door), and Arcite with his three Knights (at the
     other door)

    PIRITHOUS
     Sir, they enter.

    THESEUS
     You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,
     You royal german foes that this day come
     To blow that nearness out that flames between ye,
     Lay by your anger for an hour and, dove-like,
     Before the holy altars of your helpers,
     The all-feared gods, bow down your stubborn bodies.
     Your ire is more than mortal - so your help be;
     And as the gods regard ye, fight with justice.
     I'll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt ye
     I part my wishes.

    PIRITHOUS
     Honour crown the worthiest.
     Exit Theseus and his train

    PALAMON
     (to Arcite)
     The glass is running now that cannot finish
     Till one of us expire. Think you but thus,
     That were there aught in me which strove to show
     Mine enemy in this business, were't one eye
     Against another, arm oppressed by arm,
     I would destroy th' offender - coz, I would,
     Though parcel of myself. Then from this gather
     How I should tender you.

    ARCITE
     I am in labour
     To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred,
     Out of my memory, and i'th' selfsame place
     To seat something I would confound. So hoist we
     The sails that must these vessels port even where
     The heavenly limiter pleases.

    PALAMON
     You speak well.
     Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin -
     This I shall never do again.

    ARCITE
     One farewell.

    PALAMON
     Why, let it be so - farewell, coz.

    ARCITE
     Farewell, sir.
     Exeunt Palamon and his three Knights
     Knights, kinsmen, lovers - yea, my sacrifices,
     True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you
     Expels the seeds of fear and th' apprehension
     Which still is father of it, go with me
     Before the god of our profession. There
     Require of him the hearts of lions and
     The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,
     Yea, the speed also - to go on, I mean,
     Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize
     Must be dragged out of blood - force and great feat
     Must put my garland on me, where she sticks,
     The queen of flowers. Our intercession, then,
     Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern
     Brimmed with the blood of men - give me your aid,
     And bend your spirits towards him.
     They kneel before the altar, (fall on their faces, then
     on their knees again)
     (Praying to Mars) Thou mighty one,
     That with thy power hast turned green Neptune into purple;
     Whose havoc in vast field comets prewarn,
     Unearthäd skulls proclaim; whose breath blows down
     The teeming Ceres' foison; who dost pluck
     With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds
     The masoned turrets, that both mak'st and break'st
     The stony girths of cities; me thy pupil,
     Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day
     With military skill, that to thy laud
     I may advance my streamer, and by thee
     Be styled the lord o'th' day. Give me, great Mars,
     Some token of thy pleasure.
     Here they fall on their faces, as formerly, and there
     is heard clanging of armour, with a short thunder,
     as the burst of a battle, whereupon they all rise and
     bow to the altar
     O great corrector of enormous times,
     Shaker of o'er-rank states, thou grand decider
     Of dusty and old titles, that heal'st with blood
     The earth when it is sick, and cur'st the world
     O'th' plurisy of people, I do take
     Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name,
     To my design, march boldly. (To his Knights) Let us go.
     Exeunt

 5.2 Scene 2
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter Palamon and his Knights with the former observance

    PALAMON
     (to his Knights)
     Our stars must glister with new fire, or be
     Today extinct. Our argument is love,
     Which if the goddess of it grant, she gives
     Victory too. Then blend your spirits with mine,
     You whose free nobleness do make my cause
     Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus
     Commend we our proceeding, and implore
     Her power unto our party.
     Here they kneel before the altar, (fall on their faces
     then on their knees again)
     (Praying to Venus) Hail, sovereign queen of secrets,
     who hast power
     To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage
     And weep unto a girl; that hast the might,
     Even with an eye-glance, to choke Mars's drum
     And turn th' alarum to whispers; that canst make
     A cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure him
     Before Apollo; that mayst force the king
     To be his subject's vassal, and induce
     Stale gravity to dance; the polled bachelor
     Whose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires,
     Have skipped thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch
     And make him to the scorn of his hoarse throat
     Abuse young lays of love. What godlike power
     Hast thou not power upon? To Phoebus thou
     Add'st flames hotter than his - the heavenly fires
     Did scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress,
     All moist and cold, some say, began to throw
     Her bow away and sigh. Take to thy grace
     Me, thy vowed soldier, who do bear thy yoke
     As 'twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier
     Than lead itself, stings more than nettles.
     I have never been foul-mouthed against thy law;
     Ne'er revealed secret, for I knew none; would not,
     Had I kenned all that were. I never practised
     Upon man's wife, nor would the libels read
     Of liberal wits. I never at great feasts
     Sought to betray a beauty, but have blushed
     At simp'ring sirs that did. I have been harsh
     To large confessors, and have hotly asked them
     If they had mothers - I had one, a woman,
     And women 'twere they wronged. I knew a man
     Of eighty winters, this I told them, who
     A lass of fourteen brided - 'twas thy power
     To put life into dust. The agäd cramp
     Had screwed his square foot round,
     The gout had knit his fingers into knots,
     Torturing convulsions from his globy eyes
     Had almost drawn their spheres, that what was life
     In him seemed torture. This anatomy
     Had by his young fair fere a boy, and I
     Believed it was his, for she swore it was,
     And who would not believe her? Brief - I am
     To those that prate and have done, no companion;
     To those that boast and have not, a defier;
     To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.
     Yea, him I do not love that tells close offices
     The foulest way, nor names concealments in
     The boldest language. Such a one I am,
     And vow that lover never yet made sigh
     Truer than I. O, then, most soft sweet goddess,
     Give me the victory of this question, which
     Is true love's merit, and bless me with a sign
     Of thy great pleasure.
     Here music is heard, doves are seen to flutter. They
     fall again upon their faces, then on their knees
     O thou that from eleven to ninety reign'st
     In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world
     And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks
     For this fair token, which, being laid unto
     Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance
     My body to this business. (To his Knights) Let us rise
     And bow before the goddess.
     They rise and bow
     Time comes on.
     Exeunt

 5.3 Scene 3
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Still music of recorders. Enter Emilia in white, her
     hair about her shoulders, with a wheaten wreath;
     one in white holding up her train, her hair stuck
     with flowers; one before her carrying a silver hind
     in which is conveyed incense and sweet odours,
     which being set upon the altar, her maids standing
     apart, she sets fire to it. Then they curtsy and kneel

    EMILIA
     (praying to Diana)
     O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,
     Abandoner of revels, mute contemplative,
     Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure
     As wind-fanned snow, who to thy female knights
     Allow'st no more blood than will make a blush,
     Which is their order's robe: I here, thy priest,
     Am humbled fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe
     With that thy rare green eye, which never yet
     Beheld thing maculate, look on thy virgin;
     And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear -
     Which ne'er heard scurril term, into whose port
     Ne'er entered wanton sound - to my petition,
     Seasoned with holy fear. This is my last
     Of vestal office. I am bride-habited,
     But maiden-hearted. A husband I have 'pointed,
     But do not know him. Out of two, I should
     Choose one and pray for his success, but I
     Am guiltless of election. Of mine eyes
     Were I to lose one, they are equal precious -
     I could doom neither: that which perished should
     Go to't unsentenced. Therefore, most modest queen,
     He of the two pretenders that best loves me
     And has the truest title in't, let him
     Take off my wheaten garland, or else grant
     The file and quality I hold I may
     Continue in thy band.
     Here the hind vanishes under the altar and in the
     place ascends a rose tree having one rose upon it
     (To her women) See what our general of ebbs and flows
     Out from the bowels of her holy altar,
     With sacred act, advances - but one rose!
     If well inspired, this battle shall confound
     Both these brave knights, and I a virgin flower
     Must grow alone, unplucked.
     Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments and
     the rose falls from the tree
     The flower is fall'n, the tree descends. (To Diana) O
     mistress,
     Thou here dischargest me - I shall be gathered.
     I think so, but I know not thine own will.
     Unclasp thy mystery. (To her women) I hope she's
     pleased;
     Her signs were gracious.
     They curtsy and exeunt

 5.4 Scene 4
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter the Doctor, the Jailer, and the Wooer in the habit of Palamon

    DOCTOR
     Has this advice I told you done any good upon
     her?

    WOOER
     O, very much. The maids that kept her company
     have half persuaded her that I am Palamon. Within
     this half-hour she came smiling to me, and asked me
     what I would eat, and when I would kiss her.
     I told her presently, and kissed her twice.

    DOCTOR
     'Twas well done - twenty times had been far better,
     For there the cure lies mainly.

    WOOER
     Then she told me
     She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew
     What hour my fit would take me.

    DOCTOR
     Let her do so,
     And when your fit comes, fit her home,
     And presently.

    WOOER
     She would have me sing.

    DOCTOR
     You did so?

    WOOER
     No.

    DOCTOR
     'Twas very ill done, then.
     You should observe her every way.

    WOOER
     Alas,
     I have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way.

    DOCTOR
     That's all one, if ye make a noise.
     If she entreat again, do anything -
     Lie with her if she ask you.

    JAILER
     Ho there, Doctor.

    DOCTOR
     Yes, in the way of cure.

    JAILER
     But first, by your leave,
     I'th' way of honesty.

    DOCTOR
     That's but a niceness -
     Ne'er cast your child away for honesty.
     Cure her first this way, then if she will be honest,
     She has the path before her.

    JAILER
     Thank ye, Doctor.

    DOCTOR
     Pray bring her in and let's see how she is.

    JAILER
     I will, and tell her her Palamon stays for her.
     But, Doctor, methinks you are i'th' wrong still.
     Exit Jailer

    DOCTOR
     Go, go. You fathers are fine fools - her honesty?
     An we should give her physic till we find that -

    WOOER
     Why, do you think she is not honest, sir?

    DOCTOR
     How old is she?

    WOOER
     She's eighteen.

    DOCTOR
     She may be -
     But that's all one. 'Tis nothing to our purpose.
     Whate'er her father says, if you perceive
     Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of,
     Videlicet, the way of flesh - you have me?

    WOOER
     Yes, very well, sir.

    DOCTOR
     Please her appetite,
     And do it home - it cures her, ipso facto,
     The melancholy humour that infects her.

    WOOER
     I am of your mind, Doctor.
     Enter the Jailer and his Daughter, (mad)

    DOCTOR
     You'll find it so - she comes: pray humour her.
     (The Doctor and the Wooer stand apart)

    JAILER
     (to his Daughter)
     Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child,
     And has done this long hour, to visit you.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I thank him for his gentle patience.
     He's a kind gentleman, and I am much bound to him.
     Did you ne'er see the horse he gave me?

    JAILER
     Yes.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     How do you like him?

    JAILER
     He's a very fair one.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     You never saw him dance?

    JAILER
     No.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     I have, often.
     He dances very finely, very comely,
     And, for a jig, come cut and long-tail to him,
     He turns ye like a top.

    JAILER
     That's fine, indeed.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     He'll dance the morris twenty mile an hour,
     And that will founder the best hobbyhorse,
     If I have any skill, in all the parish -
     And gallops to the tune of 'Light o' love'.
     What think you of this horse?

    JAILER
     Having these virtues
     I think he might be brought to play at tennis.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Alas, that's nothing.

    JAILER
     Can he write and read too?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     A very fair hand, and casts himself th' accounts
     Of all his hay and provender. That ostler
     Must rise betime that cozens him. You know
     The chestnut mare the Duke has?

    JAILER
     Very well.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,
     But he is like his master - coy and scornful.

    JAILER
     What dowry has she?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Some two hundred bottles
     And twenty strike of oats, but he'll ne'er have her.
     He lisps in's neighing, able to entice
     A miller's mare. He'll be the death of her.

    DOCTOR
     What stuff she utters!

    JAILER
     Make curtsy - here your love comes.

    WOOER
     (coming forward)
     Pretty soul,
     How do ye?
     She curtsies
     That's a fine maid, there's a curtsy.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Yours to command, i'th' way of honesty -
     How far is't now to th' end o'th' world, my masters?

    DOCTOR
     Why, a day's journey, wench.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     (to Wooer)
     Will you go with me?

    WOOER
     What shall we do there, wench?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Why, play at stool-ball -
     What is there else to do?

    WOOER
     I am content
     If we shall keep our wedding there.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     'Tis true -
     For there, I will assure you, we shall find
     Some blind priest for the purpose that will venture
     To marry us, for here they are nice, and foolish.
     Besides, my father must be hanged tomorrow,
     And that would be a blot i'th' business.
     Are not you Palamon?

    WOOER
     Do not you know me?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Yes, but you care not for me. I have nothing
     But this poor petticoat and two coarse smocks.

    WOOER
     That's all one - I will have you.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Will you surely?

    WOOER
     Yes, by this fair hand, will I.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     We'll to bed then.

    WOOER
     E'en when you will.
     He kisses her

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     (rubbing off the kiss)
     O, sir, you would fain be nibbling.

    WOOER
     Why do you rub my kiss off?

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     'Tis a sweet one,
     And will perfume me finely against the wedding.
     (Indicating the Doctor) Is not this your cousin Arcite?

    DOCTOR
     Yes, sweetheart,
     And I am glad my cousin Palamon
     Has made so fair a choice.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     Do you think he'll have me?

    DOCTOR
     Yes, without doubt.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     (to the Jailer)
     Do you think so too?

    JAILER
     Yes.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     We shall have many children. (To the Doctor) Lord,
     how you're grown!
     My Palamon, I hope, will grow too, finely,
     Now he's at liberty. Alas, poor chicken,
     He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging,
     But I'll kiss him up again.
     Enter a Messenger

    MESSENGER
     What do you here? You'll lose the noblest sight
     That e'er was seen.

    JAILER
     Are they i'th' field?

    MESSENGER
     They are -
     You bear a charge there too.

    JAILER
     I'll away straight.
     (To the others) I must e'en leave you here.

    DOCTOR
     Nay, we'll go with you -
     I will not lose the sight.

    JAILER
     How did you like her?

    DOCTOR
     I'll warrant you, within these three or four days
     I'll make her right again.
     (Exit the Jailer with the Messenger)
     (To the Wooer)
     You must not from her,
     But still preserve her in this way.

    WOOER
     I will.

    DOCTOR
     Let's get her in.

    WOOER
     (to the Jailer's Daughter)
     Come, sweet, we'll go to dinner,
     And then we'll play at cards.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     And shall we kiss too?

    WOOER
     A hundred times.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     And twenty.

    WOOER
     Ay, and twenty.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     And then we'll sleep together.

    DOCTOR
     (to the Wooer)
     Take her offer.

    WOOER
     (to the Jailer's Daughter)
     Yes, marry, will we.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     But you shall not hurt me.

    WOOER
     I will not, sweet.

    JAILER'S DAUGHTER
     If you do, love, I'll cry.
     Exeunt

     Flourish. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous,
     and some attendants

    EMILIA
     I'll no step further.

    PIRITHOUS
     Will you lose this sight?

    EMILIA
     I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly
     Than this decision. Every blow that falls
     Threats a brave life; each stroke laments
     The place whereon it falls, and sounds more like
     A bell than blade. I will stay here.
     It is enough my hearing shall be punished
     With what shall happen, 'gainst the which there is
     No deafing, but to hear; not taint mine eye
     With dread sights it may shun.

    PIRITHOUS
     (to Theseus)
     Sir, my good lord,
     Your sister will no further.

    THESEUS
     O, she must.
     She shall see deeds of honour in their kind,
     Which sometime show well pencilled. Nature now
     Shall make and act the story, the belief
     Both sealed with eye and ear. (To Emilia) You must be
     present -
     You are the victor's meed, the price and garland
     To crown the question's title.

    EMILIA
     Pardon me,
     If I were there I'd wink.

    THESEUS
     You must be there -
     This trial is, as 'twere, i'th' night, and you
     The only star to shine.

    EMILIA
     I am extinct.
     There is but envy in that light which shows
     The one the other. Darkness, which ever was
     The dam of horror, who does stand accursed
     Of many mortal millions, may even now,
     By casting her black mantle over both,
     That neither could find other, get herself
     Some part of a good name, and many a murder
     Set off whereto she's guilty.

    HIPPOLYTA
     You must go.

    EMILIA
     In faith, I will not.

    THESEUS
     Why, the knights must kindle
     Their valour at your eye. Know, of this war
     You are the treasure, and must needs be by
     To give the service pay.

    EMILIA
     Sir, pardon me -
     The title of a kingdom may be tried
     Out of itself.

    THESEUS
     Well, well - then at your pleasure.
     Those that remain with you could wish their office
     To any of their enemies.

    HIPPOLYTA
     Farewell, sister.
     I am like to know your husband fore yourself,
     By some small start of time. He whom the gods
     Do of the two know best, I pray them he
     Be made your lot.
     Exeunt all but Emilia
     (Emilia takes out two pictures, one from her right side,
     and one from her left)

    EMILIA
     Arcite is gently visaged, yet
     his eyeIs like an engine bent or a sharp weapon
     In a soft sheath. Mercy and manly courage
     Are bedfellows in his visage. Palamon
     Has a most menacing aspect. His brow
     Is graved and seems to bury what it frowns on,
     Yet sometime 'tis not so, but alters to
     The quality of his thoughts. Long time his eye
     Will dwell upon his object. Melancholy
     Becomes him nobly - so does Arcite's mirth.
     But Palamon's sadness is a kind of mirth,
     So mingled as if mirth did make him sad
     And sadness merry. Those darker humours that
     Stick misbecomingly on others, on them
     Live in fair dwelling.
     Cornetts. Trumpets sound as to a charge
     Hark, how yon spurs to spirit do incite
     The princes to their proof. Arcite may win me,
     And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to
     The spoiling of his figure. O, what pity
     Enough for such a chance! If I were by
     I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes
     Toward my seat, and in that motion might
     Omit a ward or forfeit an offence
     Which craved that very time. It is much better
     Cornetts. A great cry and noise within, crying, 'A
     Palamon'
     I am not there. O better never born,
     Than minister to such harm.
     Enter Servant
     What is the chance?

    SERVANT
     The cry's 'A Palamon'.

    EMILIA
     Then he has won. 'Twas ever likely -
     He looked all grace and success, and he is
     Doubtless the prim'st of men. I prithee run
     And tell me how it goes.
     Shout and cornetts, crying, 'A Palamon'

    SERVANT
     Still 'Palamon'.

    EMILIA
     Run and enquire.
     Exit Servant
     (She speaks to the picture in her right hand)
     Poor servant, thou hast lost.
     Upon my right side still I wore thy picture,
     Palamon's on the left. Why so, I know not.
     I had no end in't, else chance would have it so.
     Another cry and shout within and cornetts
     On the sinister side the heart lies - Palamon
     Had the best-boding chance. This burst of clamour
     Is sure the end o'th' combat.
     Enter Servant

    SERVANT
     They said that Palamon had Arcite's body
     Within an inch o'th' pyramid - that the cry
     Was general 'A Palamon'. But anon
     Th'assistants made a brave redemption, and
     The two bold titlers at this instant are
     Hand to hand at it.

    EMILIA
     Were they metamorphosed
     Both into one! O why? There were no woman
     Worth so composed a man: their single share,
     Their nobleness peculiar to them, gives
     The prejudice of disparity, value's shortness,
     To any lady breathing -
     Cornetts. Cry within, 'Arcite, Arcite'
     More exulting?
     'Palamon' still?

    SERVANT
     Nay, now the sound is 'Arcite'.

    EMILIA
     I prithee, lay attention to the cry.
     Cornetts. A great shout and cry, 'Arcite, victory!'
     Set both thine ears to th' business.

    SERVANT
     The cry is
     'Arcite' and 'Victory' - hark, 'Arcite, victory!'
     The combat's consummation is proclaimed
     By the wind instruments.

    EMILIA
     Half sights saw
     That Arcite was no babe. God's lid, his richness
     And costliness of spirit looked through him - it could
     No more be hid in him than fire in flax,
     Than humble banks can go to law with waters
     That drift winds force to raging. I did think
     Good Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not
     Why I did think so. Our reasons are not prophets
     When oft our fancies are. They are coming off -
     Alas, poor Palamon.
     (She puts away the pictures.)
     Cornetts. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous,
     Arcite as victor, and attendants

    THESEUS
     Lo, where our sister is in expectation,
     Yet quaking and unsettled. Fairest Emily,
     The gods by their divine arbitrament
     Have given you this knight. He is a good one
     As ever struck at head. (To Arcite and Emilia)
     Give me your hands.
     (To Arcite) Receive you her, (to Emilia) you him:
     (to both) be plighted with
     A love that grows as you decay.

    ARCITE
     Emilia,
     To buy you I have lost what's dearest to me
     Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply
     As I do rate your value.

    THESEUS
     (to Emilia)
     O loväd sister,
     He speaks now of as brave a knight as e'er
     Did spur a noble steed. Surely the gods
     Would have him die a bachelor lest his race
     Should show i'th' world too godlike. His behaviour
     So charmed me that, methought, Alcides was
     To him a sow of lead. If I could praise
     Each part of him to th' all I have spoke, your Arcite
     Did not lose by't; for he that was thus good,
     Encountered yet his better. I have heard
     Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o'th' night
     With their contentious throats, now one the higher,
     Anon the other, then again the first,
     And by and by out-breasted, that the sense
     Could not be judge between 'em - so it fared
     Good space between these kinsmen, till heavens did
     Make hardly one the winner. (To Arcite) Wear the
     garland
     With joy that you have won. - For the subdued,
     Give them our present justice, since I know
     Their lives but pinch 'em. Let it here be done.
     The scene's not for our seeing; go we hence
     Right joyful, with some sorrow. (To Arcite) Arm your
     prize;
     I know you will not lose her. Hippolyta,
     I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,
     The which it will deliver.
     Flourish

    EMILIA
     Is this winning?
     O all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?
     But that your wills have said it must be so,
     And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,
     This miserable prince, that cuts away
     A life more worthy from him than all women,
     I should and would die too.

    HIPPOLYTA
     Infinite pity
     That four such eyes should be so fixed on one
     That two must needs be blind for't.

    THESEUS
     So it is.
     Exeunt

 5.6 Scene 6
 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Enter, guarded, Palamon and his three Knights
     pinioned; enter with them the Jailer and an
     executioner with block and axe

    PALAMON
     There's many a man alive that hath outlived
     The love o'th' people; yea, i'th' selfsame state
     Stands many a father with his child: some comfort
     We have by so considering. We expire,
     And not without men's pity; to live still,
     Have their good wishes. We prevent
     The loathsome misery of age, beguile
     The gout and rheum that in lag hours attend
     For grey approachers; we come towards the gods
     Young and unwappered, not halting under crimes
     Many and stale - that sure shall please the gods
     Sooner than such, to give us nectar with 'em,
     For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,
     Whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down,
     You have sold 'em too too cheap.

    FIRST KNIGHT
     What ending could be
     Of more content? O'er us the victors have
     Fortune, whose title is as momentary
     As to us death is certain - a grain of honour
     They not o'erweigh us.

    SECOND KNIGHT
     Let us bid farewell,
     And with our patience anger tott'ring fortune,
     Who at her certain'st reels.

    THIRD KNIGHT
     Come, who begins?

    PALAMON
     E'en he that led you to this banquet shall
     Taste to you all. (To the Jailer) Aha, my friend, my
     friend,
     Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;
     You'll see't done now for ever. Pray, how does she?
     I heard she was not well; her kind of ill
     Gave me some sorrow.

    JAILER
     Sir, she's well restored
     And to be married shortly.

    PALAMON
     By my short life,
     I am most glad on't. 'Tis the latest thing
     I shall be glad of. Prithee, tell her so;
     Commend me to her, and to piece her portion
     Tender her this.
     He gives his purse

    FIRST KNIGHT
     Nay, let's be offerers all.

    SECOND KNIGHT
     Is it a maid?

    PALAMON
     Verily, I think so -
     A right good creature more to me deserving
     Than I can quit or speak of.

    ALL THREE KNIGHTS
     Commend us to her.
     They give their purses

    JAILER
     The gods requite you all, and make her thankful.

    PALAMON
     Adieu, and let my life be now as short
     As my leave-taking.
     He lies on the block

    FIRST KNIGHT
     Lead, courageous cousin.

    SECOND AND THIRD KNIGHTS
     We'll follow cheerfully.
     A great noise within: crying, 'Run! Save! Hold!'
     Enter in haste a Messenger

    MESSENGER
     Hold! Hold! O, hold! Hold! Hold!
     Enter Pirithous in haste

    PIRITHOUS
     Hold, ho! It is a cursäd haste you made
     If you have done so quickly! Noble Palamon,
     The gods will show their glory in a life
     That thou art yet to lead.

    PALAMON
     Can that be,
     When Venus, I have said, is false? How do things fare?

    PIRITHOUS
     Arise, great sir, and give the tidings ear
     That are most rarely sweet and bitter.

    PALAMON
     What
     Hath waked us from our dream?

    PIRITHOUS
     List, then: your cousin,
     Mounted upon a steed that Emily
     Did first bestow on him, a black one owing
     Not a hair-worth of white - which some will say
     Weakens his price and many will not buy
     His goodness with this note; which superstition
     Here finds allowance - on this horse is Arcite
     Trotting the stones of Athens, which the calkins
     Did rather tell than trample; for the horse
     Would make his length a mile, if't pleased his rider
     To put pride in him. As he thus went counting
     The flinty pavement, dancing, as 'twere, to th' music
     His own hooves made - for, as they say, from iron
     Came music's origin - what envious flint,
     Cold as old Saturn and like him possessed
     With fire malevolent, darted a spark,
     Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,
     I comment not - the hot horse, hot as fire,
     Took toy at this and fell to what disorder
     His power could give his will; bounds; comes on end;
     Forgets school-doing, being therein trained
     And of kind manäge; pig-like he whines
     At the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather
     Than any jot obeys; seeks all foul means
     Of boist'rous and rough jad'ry to disseat
     His lord, that kept it bravely. When naught served,
     When neither curb would crack, girth break, nor diff'ring plunges
     Disroot his rider whence he grew, but that
     He kept him 'tween his legs, on his hind hooves -
     On end he stands -
     That Arcite's legs, being higher than his head,
     Seemed with strange art to hang. His victor's wreath
     Even then fell off his head; and presently
     Backward the jade comes o'er and his full poise
     Becomes the rider's load. Yet is he living;
     But such a vessel 'tis that floats but for
     The surge that next approaches. He much desires
     To have some speech with you - lo, he appears.
     Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, and Arcite in a chair
     borne by attendants

    PALAMON
     O miserable end of our alliance!
     The gods are mighty. Arcite, if thy heart,
     Thy worthy manly heart, be yet unbroken,
     Give me thy last words. I am Palamon,
     One that yet loves thee dying.

    ARCITE
     Take Emilia,
     And with her all the world's joy. Reach thy hand -
     Farewell - I have told my last hour. I was false,
     Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin -
     One kiss from fair Emilia - (they kiss) 'tis done.
     Take her; I die.
     He dies

    PALAMON
     Thy brave soul seek Elysium.

    EMILIA
     (to Arcite's body)
     I'll close thine eyes, Prince. Blessäd souls be with thee.
     Thou art a right good man, and, while I live,
     This day I give to tears.

    PALAMON
     And I to honour.

    THESEUS
     In this place first you fought, e'en very here
     I sundered you. Acknowledge to the gods
     Our thanks that you are living.
     His part is played, and, though it were too short,
     He did it well. Your day is lengthened and
     The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you.
     The powerful Venus well hath graced her altar,
     And given you your love; our master, Mars,
     Hath vouched his oracle, and to Arcite gave
     The grace of the contention. So the deities
     Have showed due justice. - Bear this hence.
     (Exeunt attendants with Arcite's body)

    PALAMON
     O cousin,
     That we should things desire which do cost us
     The loss of our desire! That naught could buy
     Dear love, but loss of dear love!

    THESEUS
     Never fortune
     Did play a subtler game - the conquered triumphs,
     The victor has the loss. Yet in the passage
     The gods have been most equal. Palamon,
     Your kinsman hath confessed the right o'th' lady
     Did lie in you, for you first saw her and
     Even then proclaimed your fancy. He restored her
     As your stol'n jewel, and desired your spirit
     To send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice
     Take from my hand, and they themselves become
     The executioners. Lead your lady off,
     And call your lovers from the stage of death,
     Whom I adopt my friends. A day or two
     Let us look sadly and give grace unto
     The funeral of Arcite, in whose end
     The visages of bridegrooms we'll put on
     And smile with Palamon, for whom an hour,
     But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry
     As glad of Arcite, and am now as glad
     As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,
     What things you make of us! For what we lack
     We laugh, for what we have, are sorry; still
     Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful
     For that which is, and with you leave dispute
     That are above our question. Let's go off
     And bear us like the time.
     Flourish. Exeunt

    Epilogue
     Enter Epilogue

    EPILOGUE
     I would now ask ye how ye like the play,
     But, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say.
     I am cruel fearful. Pray yet stay awhile,
     And let me look upon ye. No man smile?
     Then it goes hard, I see. He that has
     Loved a young handsome wench, then, show his face -
     'Tis strange if none be here - and, if he will,
     Against his conscience let him hiss and kill
     Our market. 'Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye.
     Have at the worst can come, then! Now, what say ye?
     And yet mistake me not - I am not bold -
     We have no such cause. If the tale we have told -
     For 'tis no other - any way content ye,
     For to that honest purpose it was meant ye,
     We have our end; and ye shall have ere long,
     I dare say, many a better to prolong
     Your old loves to us. We and all our might
     Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.
     Flourish. Exit
