Welcome to the SF Author Lists archive.  I'm John Wenn (MIT '81 (6-3),
currently in Los Angeles doing Unix programming at Xerox), and I'm
responsible for this.  The master copy of all of these lists are held
on the machine "ftp.std.com", directory pub/jwenn.  (It used to be on
"world.std.com", but now world has a separate machine for ftp access.)

It all started in November 1988, when someone on the net asked "Does
anyone have a complete list of books by Poul Anderson, Lin Carter,
Fritz Leiber or Fred Saberhagen?" Well, having the time free, owning
the necessary expensive reference works (SF bibliography is a hobby of
mine), and Jerry Boyajian ("bibliography is his business") was taking a
holiday from SF-lovers at the time, I compiled the list of books for
each author and sent them out on the net.  After answering those
authors, I got several thanks, plus multiple requests of "Could you
please do my favorite authors too?".  I've now posted 296 authors, all
of which are available here for anonymous ftp.

The last batch of authors I posted was some time ago (July 1992), but I
do keep the lists up to date.  Once a month (generally around the
middle of the month), I update all the lists.  Updates generally are
new books (either announced or released) as either personally seen by
me or listed in "Locus".  But I also include corrections, new
pseudonyms discovered, corrections received from the author, and other
miscellaneous changes.  When I have direct feedback from the author, I
tend to take their word for it (especially for things like what books
are in which series and in which order).

I'm currently working on a forthcoming SF Encyclopedia.  "The
Encyclopaedia Galactica" will consist of three volumes, the
Encyclopedias _Galactica_, _Fantasia_ and _Horrifica_.  Each will be
cross referenced both internally and to each other.  The books will
feature "signature pieces," original essays by Marion Zimmer Bradley,
L. Sprague de Camp, Frank Robinson, Anne McCaffrey, Norman Spinrad,
Robert Bloch, and others, plus reprint essays by various authors.
There will be general articles on "everything from Space Travel to the
Living Dead to Arthurian Fantasy."  Each volume will also include
author/editor/artist listings (Biographies & complete book
bibliographies noting series); sections on publishing (pro & fan &
major series); listings of organizations and awards (pro & fan); film
reviews; and probably other stuff I've forgotten.  See articles in
"Locus" (3/93 & 10/93) for more information.

I'm doing all the bibliographic research for the SF and Fantasy
volumes.  The books will be edited by Lydia Marano and published by
Prentice Hall, starting in 1996 (subject to change without notice).
The current plan is for each volume to be both smaller and cheaper than
the latest _The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_ by Clute & Nicholls.
Other differences between them include (1) Galactica is both smaller
(in total SF size) and larger (it covers Fantasy and Horror with
complete cross references between volumes);  (2) Galactica has most of
the articles written by contributors (big name authors and researchers)
while most (85%) of Clute & Nicholls was written by them (with
Stableford);  (3) Galactica's book lists are both more complete and
more useful (but then I'm probably biased).

Since I'm actually getting paid for my Encyclopedia work, and since
Lydia feels that my lists are a good part of the value of the
Encyclopedia, I won't be posting new Author Lists to the net.  I also
don't permit others to publish the lists, since they are competing with
upcoming Encyclopedia (e.g. the Clarinet 1993 Hugo Anthology CD-ROM).
I'll probably release the information after the books are published.
And in the mean time, I get the feedback directly from the authors
(since Lydia is sending my lists to the authors for comment).

If you have any questions, want an author I haven't released yet
(individual use is a different issue), or have corrections to the
lists, be sure and let me know.

----------------------------------------------------------------
A number of people have written and asked what references I've used for
my Author Lists.  So here is a list of my most used references, from most
useful to least used:

R. Reginald - SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY LITERATURE (2 Volumes) (1979)
This is my core reference.  It covers 15,884 SF books from 1700 to 1974
(plus about 2000 retitlings).  In addition it covers 1443 biographies of
SF&F people.  The book entries have title, alternate title, series and
information on first publication (year, publisher, etc.).  This is
exceptionally accurate and complete.  The only problem is that it's
quickly becoming dated.  A update has been promised in "Forthcoming Books
In Print" for several years now (covering 1975 - 1990, 2 Volumes, 12/1992,
$199.00, 1500 pages), but I'll believe it when I see it.  (Please release
it soon!)

Noelle Watson & Paul Schellinger, Ed. - TWENTIETH-CENTURY SCIENCE-FICTION
WRITERS (3rd edition) (1991).  Larger than the second edition, it has
all of the originals strengths and faults.  This covers the works of 641
SF writers, lists all their works until 1991 (including non-SF fiction
and non-fiction in a separate categories) and has an essay on the author.
Unfortunately, this book isn't as useful as it could be (although it is
better than the first edition).  There are several entries that are
sloppy or incorrect (large publishers are generally OK, but small press
books are often wrong).  In addition it has an incomprehensible system
for putting a book in the SF list or the Other list (hard SF == SF,
Mystery/Western/Romance == Other, Fantasy == Other [but not always, often
different books in the same fantasy series are split between the
categories!!]).  This is really annoying for authors who write a mixture
of genre & non-genre works.  It does have a useful listing of all
uncollected (in an single author collection) short stories [Randall
Garrett has nearly 200 uncollected stories listed!]  I generally only
use this for the 1974-1984 gap, and can only use it if it's one of the
641 people listed. (and can ignore it when Reginald's releases his update).

Charles N. Brown & William Contento - "SCIENCE FICTION IN PRINT: 1985"
(1986), "SCIENCE FICTION, FANTASY, & HORROR: 1986" (1987), (plus
volumes covering 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990 & 1991).  This yearly
reference contains:  (1) A listing of all books published that year
(basically a concatenation of the "Books Received" section from Locus,
see below), (2) A listing of stories published in SF magazines, new
anthologies and new collections (it doesn't give the contents of
reprinted anthologies or collections), (3) Misc info (year in review,
awards, deaths, recommended reading, and the like).  The book list and
story list are given in several formats:  by author, by title, items
originally published this year, by subject (books) and by contents
(books).  The 1985 version is barely readable, 1986 & 1987 is a vast
improvement, and all the others are even better (in format,
organization and typeface).  New volumes should be released every
year.

Kurt Baty & Willie Siros - THE WHOLE SCIENCE FICTION DATA BASE
QUARTERLY, volumes 2-12 (covering letters B, C, D, N, T-Z).  This
ambitious project is attempting to list all editions of all SF books ever
published in English.  This is a work in progress, with new a new volume
coming out 4 times per year.  (Or at least it's supposed to.  I haven't
recieved any new volumes since late 1990).  It's reasonably complete, but
by no means error free.  [I send them several pages of additions and
corrections every volume].  If everyone who uses the reference also
sends in corrections, the final will hopefully be reasonably correct and
complete.

Jack Chalker & Mark Owings - THE SCIENCE-FANTASY PUBLISHERS  (3rd
edition) (1991)  This covers the world of SF specialty presses.
Subtitled "A Critical and Bibliographic History", it is both a useful
bibliographic reference (a listing of books) and a critical history (of
both individual books and publishers) for about 150 SF presses, with
information on a further 50 related publishers.  It seems complete on
the publishers it does cover (but small presses are not my strong
suit), but I know of several small press publishers that were omitted.
Several people who reviewed it in _Locus_ had strong disagreements with
the critical and historical portions of the volume.  But I'm not
currently interested in those parts.  You can't readily find this
information anywhere else.

LOCUS Magazine - "Books Received" section.  [I own a nearly complete run
from December 1979].  The lists all the books received by Locus from
various publishers.  This is both good and bad.  The good news is that
it doesn't have bogus listings (the bane of the bibliographer).  The bad
news is that genuine books that they didn't happen to get are left out.
It's like a theorem from math I've tried hard to forget: you can never get
an exact listing of all functions satisfying X.  Either you ignore some
functions that fit, or you include some functions that don't fit.  So do
you want accuracy or completeness?

L. W. Currey - "SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY AUTHORS - A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF
FIRST PRINTINGS OF THEIR FICTION" (1979)  What it says:  A listing of the
the first editions of all fiction written by 217 authors.  It's useful if
you need some means of identifying a first edition, but it's use is
limited because it lists all fiction without regard to genre.  It is
extremely accurate and complete.  I use it mainly as a check on Smith.

Donald Tuck - "THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY (3
Volumes)" (1974, 1978, 1982).  This lists all SF published (or reprinted)
between 1945 and 1968.  It's real problem is that it's so out of date.
It's quite accurate (but not 100%).  The real use is that it REALLY covers
all books published between 1945 and 1968.  It lists all the editions of a
book, it lists the contents(stories, etc. in the book) and lists series.
I use this when the relationship between older books isn't clear (e.g.
"Are the stories in XXX a proper subset of stories in YYY?")

William Contento - "INDEX TO SCIENCE FICTION ANTHOLOGIES AND COLLECTIONS"
(1978) & "INDEX TO SCIENCE FICTION ANTHOLOGIES AND COLLECTIONS: 1977 -
1983" (1984).  What is says: a listing of the contents of all SF
anthologies & single author collections, all the way up to 1983.  The
Brown & Contento volumes cover more recent books.  The first has about
2000 books & the second an additional 1000.  While it is weak in
hard-to-find, very old, obscure, british, or small-press books; it is
quite useful and complete for standard titles.  It's interesting to see
how many times "Nightfall", "The Cold Equations", "Microcosmic God" or "A
Martian Odyssey" have been collected [23, 21, 10 and 14 times
respectively].  Also useful when the relationship between books isn't
clear (e.g. "Are the stories in XXX a proper subset of stories in YYY?").

Various - "CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS".  I don't own these works, but I use
them at my local Public Library as an addition source.  There have been
135 volumes of the original series & 36 volumes of the new series
published so far (with about 2 more volumes published in each series
every year).  Each volume covers a couple hundred authors from all fields
of literature & journalism.  It gives an listing of the author's work
(generally directly from the author) plus a little bit about the author.
Major articles can contain several pages of essays or interviews.  It's
reasonably accurate (even if it does omit some obscure books) and makes a
good secondary source to compare to my my preliminary lists.

One thing to note is that I almost *NEVER* pay any attention to "BOOKS IN
PRINT".  It is far too unreliable to use as a serious reference work.
(It contains many bogus books, primarily ones planned by the publisher
but never actually published).

You need a completely different set of references for short stories
published in magazines (none of which I own, and most of which are out
of print).  Sorry to all the short story lovers out there.

Edited: 11-Mar-94

With the *last* "Thieves World" anthology just published (it must be the
conclusion, it says so on the cover), I thought I'd do Robert Asprin &
Lynn Abbey.  Personally I found the first few Thieves World books
interesting, but I lost interest after #4.  Now individually, both
authors have written good stuff.

I rather enjoyed Lynn Abbey's "Daughter of the Bright Moon" novel.

To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 16-Dec-91

There are actually three different Ace Specials series.

The first was done in the late 60's - early 70's by Terry Carr and had
some really great books.  The ones that weren't success at least failed
in interesting ways.  This series published many of the ground breaking
books, both by new and established writers.

The second series was done in the middle 70's without Terry Carr.  It
wasn't nearly up to the standards of the first series.

The "New" Ace Specials were again edited by Terry Carr in the middle 80's
until his death, and were a great jump in quality.  This time the goal
was to publish the first novel of the hot new SF writers in the field.
And it did, "Neuromancer" by William Gibson being only the most famous
novel.  Terry Carr's work will certainly be missed.

Edited: 30-Dec-94

Douglas Adams is the other really funny person in SF writing today (I
did Terry Pratchett last batch).  Most of this fame rests on "The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series.  This is a true multimedia
event, having been done as Radio Drama, TV, Books, Records, Pop Songs,
a Stage Play, Interactive Computer Game, and discussion of a movie
(sorry, no comic books as far as I know).  My personal favorite is
still the original 12 episode radio drama.  Give it a listen (NOT the
reading of the books).  For people who buy the omnibus edition (I've
seen for $9.95 in bookstores), there's a extra bonus story "Young
Zaphod Plays It Safe".  He's also written a couple of Dr. Who episodes,
and the fairly good Dirk Gently books.

kind enough to include an (incomplete) listing from a book jacket.  To
quote from the jacket:

    Born in Norfolk in 1925. During the Second World War he served
    in the British Army in the Far East. he began his professional
    career as a bookseller in Oxford and then went on to become
    Literary Editor of the Oxford Mail. For many years Brian Aldiss
    was a film reviewer and poet. In 1968, Aldiss was voted the UK
    most popular SF writer by the British SF Association.  And, in
    1970, he was voted "World's Best Contemporary Science Fiction
    Author".

Gee, my first list in a long time.  I'm going to be posting authors
previously requested for a while.  Let me know if there are anyone in
particular you would like to see.  Old time readers will notice that this is
a slightly different format.  The reformatting was done for the Encyclopedia
Galactica I'm working on.  Mostly it brings the lists into standard format
(years in parenthesis, only short fiction is in quotes, and the like).

The only Lloyd Alexander I've read is the Prydain Chronicles.  Like many of
the best young adult SF, I read these when I was in my 20's.  I had a lot of
catching up to do.  And I'm still a sucker for a well written juvenile.  And
the Black Cauldron is a fun series.  Great characters, and wonderful drama.
Personally, although the animated movie was fun, it's not nearly as good as
the books.  As usual.  I've heard good things about his other books, but I
haven't read them myself.

Edited: 10-Mar-94

Here's the collected SF works of Poul Anderson.  He's one of my
favorite "classic" SF authors, with a fine ear to characters and
dialogue not generally found in the 50's.  He's written far too many
books to pick any one, but I can recommend the "Trader Van Rjin"
stories in particular & "Polesotechnic Empire" series in general.  The
Hoka stories are also massively silly.

I hope everyone finds this useful.

Piers Anthony is a frustrating author.  Here is someone who is capable
of producing good stuff, but (on the whole) doesn't.  As you can see,
he goes series crazy.  His best work tends to be either stand alone
books (e.g. "Macroscope") or the first book of the series ("On a Pale
Horse" or "A Spell for Chameleon").  The quality of a series generally
goes down in proportion to its length.  Still, he produces the
occasional gem that means I can't completely write him off.  Argh.

Actually, Asimov hasn't written incredible amounts of SF.  Poul
Anderson and Andre Norton, among others, have all written more books.
In this list there are ~71 different titles.  But since there are lots
of omnibuses, and duplications, one could get all the material by
buying only ~37 different books (or nearly 1/2 of the titles are
redundant!).   Asimov has written massive amounts of non-fiction (e.g.
"Isaac Asimov's Guide to the Bible"), lots of non-SF fiction (e.g.
"Murder at the ABA") and has edited huge numbers of anthologies (both
alone ["The Hugo Winners"] and with others [mostly Martin Greenberg &
Charles Waugh]).  But I'm only including Asimov's SF fiction.

 How to Enjoy Writing (1987)

Date: 14 Dec 89 00:30:22 PST (Thursday)
Subject: Author Lists: Robert Asprin
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 16-Feb-94

With the *last* "Thieves World" anthology just published (it must be the
conclusion, it says so on the cover), I thought I'd do Robert Asprin &
Lynn Abbey.  Personally I found the first few Thieves World books
interesting, but I lost interest after #4.  Now individually, both
authors have written good stuff.

I like the Myth Adventure series.  Be warned that you must enjoy puns
of the lowest order to really appreciate these books.  A quick reading
of the titles would convince you of that.  In the first book, I also
like the quotes at the beginning of each chapter (e.g., [approximately]
"Travel is a great way of seeing new places and meeting interesting
people" - A. the Hun).  Like most series, the best are the first books,
but I still like the later ones.

Interested people should also check out various related comic books.
Ones I know are a Thieves World, a Myth Adventures series, and two
Duncan & Mallory books.

[O] == Omnibus.  Includes other books.
[= ...] == Also known by this other title.

Subject: Author Lists: Ballantine Adult Fantasies
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 27-Jun-92

The Ballantine Adult Fantasies were published in the late 60's to early
70's and edited by Lin Carter.  The "real" members of the series were
all published with a unicorn's head logo on the cover.  There were 71
books so published.  There are also another 10 books "related" to the
Ballantine Adult Fantasy series.  They were all published in the same
time frame, edited by Lin Carter (I'm fairly sure) with the same style
of cover, but without the Unicorn Head logo.  Two actually say
"Ballantine Adult Fantasy" in tiny letters next to the spine and
another two says "Ballantine Fantasy".  I've been trying to collect
them, and now have all but 5 of the real BAF's after a year of
shopping.  I haven't read very many of them, but they are a good place
to find early fantasy.  Does anyone have any favorites?

To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 5-Apr-94

J. G. Ballard is best known now for "Empire of the Sun", an
autobiographical novel made into a movie by Steven Speilberg.  But he
was a major force in the SF "new-wave" of the 1960's.  He was famous
for his experimental prose style (writing a compressed novel in 10
pages).  Not for everybody, but I can recommend The Crystal World and
The Best Short Stories of J. G. Ballard.

To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 10-Mar-94

Greg Bear usually writes in the hard-ish SF area but has written brief
excursions into fantasy ("The Infinity Concerto"/"The Serpent Mage").
His early work is quite readable, but his recent work ('83 forward)
much more mature and polished.  I like Blood Music in particular, for
a good exploration of possible consequences of genetic engineering.
Greg Bear novels tend to have scope, a quality lacking in much of SF
today.

Edited: 7-Oct-93

Well, one last batch before I go on vacation.

John Bellairs' work can be divided into two categories: "The Face in the
Frost" and his juvenile fantasy/mysteries.  "The Face in the Frost" is
a wonderful fantasy, at turns funny, witty and scary.  Really
recommended. His juveniles are an interesting mixture of magic and
mysteries.  I own most of them, but have only read novels in the
"Johnny Dixon" series.  Quite fun. The illustrations by Edward Gorey
(a marvelous illustrator, he did the opening sequence of PBS's Mystery
series) help add to the atmosphere.

[YA] == The book is for young adults (however you define them).

Edited: 5-Feb-94

James Blish not only wrote some ground-breaking SF (I recommend "Cities in
Flight" & the "After Such Knowledge" series in particular), he wrote some
of the best SF criticism and theorizing of the 1960's using the name
"William Atheling" [collected in the two "Issues at Hand" volumes, much
of which is still applicable today]. "The Seedling Stars" & "The Best of
James Blish" are good places to sample his shorter works.

Edited: 7-May-94

Robert Bloch isn't *really* a science fiction writer.  He primarily writes
horror or mystery/suspense.  But since he has been involved with SF
fandom for 65 years (first as a correspondent with H. P. Lovecraft), he's
been given the status of honorary SF pro.  And he does write some Fantasy
or humorous Science Fiction story.  His 1959 Hugo was for the story
"That Hell-Bound Train", one of the few Hugos for a straight fantasy.
And his most famous work isn't SF at all.  It's "Psycho", the novel that
Alfred Hitchcock used for his famous movie.  I've purposefully omitted
his works that contain no fantastic elements.  "The Best of Robert Bloch"
is a good selection of his SF-ish short stories.

Edited: 5-Apr-94

Ben Bova is probably best known as a magazine editor, but he's also done
quite a bit of fiction as well.  In the realm of the outright silly, I
enjoyed "The Starcrossed", a slightly fictionalized account of his (&
Harlan Ellison's) experiences with TV producers in the Starlost TV show.
On a more serious note,  I enjoyed "The Kinsman Saga", although the
politics interferes slightly with the story.

Edited: 5-Mar-94

Ray Bradbury is a major author in the SF world, but his work has never
really been part of the SF mainstream.  There is very little science in
his work, even in his most SF-ish collection "The Martian Chronicles".
Most of his work is either mood pieces, fantasy or horror.  Virtually all
of his work has been short stories (or poems or plays).  There is,
however, nothing quite like his prose.  It has a very strong sense of
place and character: small town, middle america for the most part.
People who haven't tried Bradbury (both of you), good places to start are
"The Martian Chronicles", "Fahrenheit 451" and "The Illustrated Man".

Edited: 12-Mar-94

Marion Zimmer Bradley's most famous work is the Darkover series.  I've
listed them in approximate order of internal chronology.  She's taken an
interesting approach to the internal consistency of the series:  If she
later decides that she earlier wrote something badly (which happens early
in your career), she feels free to ignore those portions which she would
do differently now.  This can frustrate readers that keep a close eye on
the internal logic of a series, but it does free the author to write
better stories when her writing skills have improved.

And as you can see, while Darkover forms a large portion of her work it
is by no means all.  Another major theme is revisionist legends (Arthur -
"The Mists of Avalon", Mozart - "Night's Daughter" & Troy - "The
Firebrand").  Personally I recommend Darkover stories from the Age of
Chaos ("Stormqueen!" & "Hawkmistress!") and "The Mists of Avalon"
(provided you don't mind revisionist arthurian legends).

David Brin is the award winning author of the Uplift series.  (Startide
Rising is probably the best).  Aside for "The Practice Effect" (an amusing
little novel, but completely light weight), I've found all of his stuff to
be quite good traditional SF.  He does good short stories too.  Now what
we need to do is clone him, so he can produce SF faster.

Edited: 7-May-94

To many, Terry Brooks epitomizes the current trend toward bad Tolkien
rip-offs.  Others like his books a lot.  Personally, I tend much more
toward the former view than the later.  Although his first book wasn't
that bad;  what the sword actually *did* was fairly clever, and the
background was well sketched (even if it did have the cliche Inn in the
middle of no-where, where do they earn their money?).  It really could
have benefitted from a strong departure from Tolkien instead of a slavish
reproduction.  It was the first _Fantasy_Best_Seller_, and as such
demonstrates the triumph of marketing over content (which is another
discussion entirely).  I haven't read any of his later books, he may have
improved.

Subject: Author Lists: Fredric Brown
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 8-Oct-93

And in a reversal of my typical policy, I'm including Fredric Brown
mystery books in addition to his SF.  That's because (1) I really like
his mysteries [they're really great, any mystery fan should try them] &
(2) many of them have been recently reprinted.

Fredric Brown is one of SF's classic humorists.  His specialty is short,
short-short & really-short stories with a twist (or twisted) ending.  He
also wrote several memorable novels: "Martians, Go Home" [where the earth
is invaded by little green men that don't *DO* anything, but do watch.
Watch everything.  And make snide comments.  I understand that it's being
made into a bad movie], "What Mad Universe" [an alternate universe where
pulp SF is real life] & "The Lights in the Sky Are Stars" [a fine serious
story of a man who isn't going into space, but helps fight for the Jupiter
project].  Read most any Fredric Brown that you can find.

Subject: Author Lists: John Brunner
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 5-Feb-94

The problem with a John Brunner book list is that he suffers from the
"across-the-pond" syndrome.  With moderately popular British author, you
get British only editions, American editions titled the same as British
editions with different contents, and American editions identical to
British editions but with a different title.  John Brunner had several of
his novels abridged when published in the US in the early 60's (typically
as 1/2 of an Ace Double).  The complete text (with revisions) was
generally published in the late-60's.

John Brunner tends to write two kinds of novels:  a standard SF novel of
above average quality, and impressive mega-novels.  Mega-novels include:
Stand on Zanzibar, The Shockwave Rider, The Sheep Look Up & The Jagged
Orbit. I also recommend The Traveler in Black.

Steven Brust is a popular author on the net.  And I like him too.  My
personal favorites are "To Reign in Hell" ('cause I like mythological
stories) and "The Sun, The Moon and the Stars" (one of the better
fictional examinations on the nature of art).  The Vlad Taltos series is
an enjoyable romp for the first two books, but then the main character (a
professional assassin), has some qualms about the nature of his work in
the third book (I don't mind the change of tone, but I do have some
problems with how the story was developed).  The fourth book in the
series is a prequel, but retains some of the tone of the third, making it
an odd mixture.  Rumor has it that more books in this series are being
written even as I type.  Attentive readers will notice links between the
Vlad Taltos books and all the other books.

From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 8-Oct-93

The three Algis Budrys novels I've read have all been very good:  "Who?"
is a tale of an injured American scientist (vital to the national defense)
returned by the Russians.  The problem is that so much of him has been
replaced with prosthetics that the Americans can't be sure it's *really*
the same person.  "Rogue Moon" contains an alien artifact (a maze) on the
far side of the moon that quickly kills anyone attempting to enter it.
"Michaelmas" is an excellent story of the secret president of Earth.
(OK, the story sounds hokey, but it's really very good).  His fiction is
particularly strong on characterization.  He's also one of the great SF
reviewers in history ("Benchmarks" is a collection of his reviews, he
currently reviews in F&SF).  And he does the "Writers of the Future"
anthologies.  I can recommend any of the three novels I've read.

Lois McMaster Bujold writes fun, well written science fiction.  In many
ways it reminds me of early Heinlein.  Not so much in the details, but
rather for the reaction they produce.  Her character "Miles Naismith
Vorkosigan" is one of the most appealing characters written in years.
Really recommended for a wonderful read.

To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 3-Jul-93

Edgar Rice Burroughs is one of the all time classic pulp writers.  As
such, one does not read him for his prose style or characterization.  Many
modern readers find him unreadable.  But, his stories do have unceasing
action, marvelously inventive worlds, brave heroes, beautiful princesses,
and unspeakable villains.  Personally, I find him kind of fun, if read in
the right mood.  I think this list is most complete for his novels, but
I've probably missed a few omnibuses along the way.  And the dates
mentioned are publication dates for the books, not copyright dates of the
original magazine articles.

From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 16-Jan-94

F. M. Busby writes very good starts to series.  I can really recommend
everything in the Hulzein Family series except "The Rebel Dynasty, Volume
II". Likewise, I liked the first two books in "The Demu Trilogy", then
the third went off in a wild tangent.

The first portion of the Hulzein series has some great, well written space
opera.  The main characters have the traditional amazing talents of space
opera, but Busby gives them correspondingly large character flaws to make
them believable.  It also has some interesting strategy on how to run a
war when you have highly relativistic space ships.  You've seen the plot
before: our heroes escape the oppressive Earth empire to gather a rebel
army and defeat the villains.  The details are what make it interesting.
The last two books take place after the heroes have won, and are not
nearly as interesting.

And by the way, the Rissa books are interesting bibliographically.  First
the series was published as two separate books, then as a single book,
then as three separate books (with the first original book being split
into two new books).  Mysterious are the ways of publishers.

Subject: Author Lists: Octavia Butler
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 7-Dec-93

Octavia Butler is a good author whose work has the unfortunate tendency to
be constantly out of print (although Questar, that most inconsistent of
publishers, seems to be reprinting much of it).  Most of her work involves
two series.  The Patternist series has a society where the Patternists
[linked telepaths controlled by the strongest] is fighting for survival
against the Clayarks [humans infected and mutated by an alien organism].
The first 2 novels goes into the origins of the Patternists, the 3rd
examines the origins of the Clayarks.  The Xenogenesis series explores the
consequences when an alien race comes upon the wreckage of Earth several
years after a wholesale nuclear war.  What they decide to do to the human
survivors, and the consequences of this act (plus the interesting nature
of the aliens themselves) forms the basis of the series.  The Patternist
novels can be read more or less independently (as you can see, the
internal chronology has little to do with the order that they were
written).  The Xenogenesis novels should be read in order.

I've had a reasonable batting average reading SF classics, and though I

The one Calvino book I've read was Cosmicomics.  It was an entertaining
collection of Scientific Fables.  Each of the stories was narrated by the
immortal Qfwfq who relates a story about some scientific principle
(The-Big-Bang: on how crowded it was back then, Continous-Creation:
Playing billiards with the spontaneously created hydrogen atoms, and the
like).  The wry tone is quite similar to Douglas Adam's "Hitchhiker's
Guide To The Galaxy".  Unfortunately, Calvino are hard to find.  Other
books of his that have been recommended that I'm still looking for are
"T-Zero" & "If on a Winter's Night a Traveler".

John W. Campbell is best known as the editor of Astounding Science Fiction
(aka Analog) for 34 years.  There he developed an amazing group of writers
(Heinlein, van Vogt, Asimov, an several others).  But he also wrote some
good stories himself.

Under his own name he wrote above average space opera.  But under the name
of Don A. Stuart, he wrote stories that read quite well today.  Probably
his most famous story was "Who Goes There?".  It was filmed (twice), but
I still prefer his version.  As usual, an excellent place to start is the
Del Rey book "The Best of John W. Campbell".

Gee, OSC was easy.  I didn't have to go home to look in any references
since I own all of his books (except the last 3, which I know about).
Aside from his award winning books (The Ender series), I really like
"Hart's Hope" (an excellent fantasy written in an unusual allegorical
style) & "Unaccompanied Sonata and Other Stories" (some really great
stories).

Ah, yes, Jonathan Carroll.  Jonathan Carroll is one of the best literary
fantasy writers in the field today.  John Crowley, Gene Wolfe (when he
does  fantasy) and James Blaylock are other top fantasists (although
Blaylock isn't  quite my taste).  As you can see many of his books are
set in the same  universe.  If you pay attention, you'll see major
characters from one book  reappear as minor characters in others.  I've
found the result of reading the  series to be cumulative, with one book
adding to the effect of the others.   I'ld recommend 'Bones of the Moon'
as a good introduction to Carroll.

Subject: Author Lists: Angela Carter
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: rec.arts.sf.written
Edited: 30-Jun-93

My all time favorite Angela Carter book is _The Bloody Chamber_.  It is
a collection of retellings of classic fairy tales in a decadent style.
If you have read Tanith Lee's _Red As Blood_, you know the type of
story.  The two books, however, have very different styles.  _Red as
Blood_ is sharp and witty, while _The Bloody Chamber_ is moody and
sensuous.  _The Bloody Chamber_ also contains "A Company of Wolves",
the source for the wonderful movie of the same name.  In fact, "A
Company of Wolves" is *the* most accurate translation from the written
word to the screen.  The movie adds an outer wrapping of a 20th century
girl, and I think the movie uses a semi-colon instead of a comma, but
aside from that one can read the story along with the movie.  Both are
a great psycho-sexual retelling of various werewolf legends, most
especially Little Red Riding Hood.  And the original story is only 12
pages long.

I've never been a fan of Jack Chalker.  He's heavily into series, and like
most series, the first books are the most interesting.  I found "Midnight
at the Well of Souls" to be fairly good and "The River of Dancing Gods"
to be a moderately funny send-up of generic fantasy novels (although not
as funny as early Robert Asprin or any Terry Pratchett).

With the latest discussion of A. Bertram Chandler (spitting on the cat and

Edited: 3-Feb-91

Joy Chant wrote three very nice fantasy novels set in the same world (they
don't really qualify as a trilogy).  It's "The High Kings", however,
that's really special in the fantasy field.  It's a retelling of the
pre-Arthurian British myths  (somewhat in the style of Evangeline Walton's
books).   Also interwoven are discussions of celtic society and culture &
(in the hard cover edition) some really incredible paintings. This is one
of the few instances of a "coffee table" book where both the text and
pictures are worth getting.  I've bought three copies of the hardcover (2
as gifts).  I think that it's still available through the Science Fiction
Book Club.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

I've read two Suzy McKee Charnas books, 'The Vampire Tapestry' & 'The
Bronze  King'.  The Vampire Tapestry is an above average vampire novel,
more fantasy  than horror.  It ignores many of the traditional vampire
attributes  (daylight, garlic, mirrors, coffins) for a tale of a human
looking predator  living within but apart from the human community.
The Bronze King is a fun  tale of two kids stumbling onto magical goings
on in New York City.  If you  think that it sounds something like Diane
Duane's Wizard series, you're  right.  I personally prefer Diane Duane,
but they are both good stories.

Edited: 10-Mar-94

C. J. Cherryh is a favorite of mine.  She sets the standard for ALIEN (but
comprehensible) aliens.  Not people in funny suits, like most authors.
(If you're looking for incomprehensible aliens, try "Solaris" by Lem).
She does great fast paced action, and intricate political schemings (often
in the same novel!).  I can recommend everything she does, with the
exception of the Heroes in Hell nonsense, and the Merovingen Nights
anthologies (which are weak but OK).

Edited: 4-Aug-93

John Christopher is now best known for his good juvenile (young adult,
whatever you want to call them) novels.  The ones I've read (The Tripods
Trilogy) was a pretty good post-alien invasion yarn.  The first two novels
were produced as a BBC TV mini-series.

John Christopher's earlier fame, however, was as one of several brits who
destroyed civilization in dozens of ways in the late 50's & early 60's.
Other members of this exclusive club include J. G. Ballard and John
Wyndham.  The best of these is probably "No Blade of Grass" (also filmed).
In it, a world wide plague kills all variety of grass.  Which doesn't
sound too bad until you realize that rice, wheat, oats, rye, etc. are all
"grasses".  He follows several ordinary people through the entire
disaster.

He's also written in a variety of other genres using the names Anthony
Rye, William Godfrey, Peter Nichols, Samuel Youd, Peter Graf and Hilary
Ford.

Arthur C. Clarke is the last of the big 3 of the fifties on my list
(Asimov & Heinlein are already done).  Clarke was always more likely to
get the science right, but without ignoring the characters (which was a
hallmark of most hard SF of the day).  Important works include
"Childhood's End", "2001: A Space Odyssey" [necessary to understand the
movie], and "The Nine Billion Names of God" [his best collection].

Hal Clement writes HARD hard SF.  His science is meticulously accurate.
Most of his novels deal with very odd worlds, and the consequences of
them (high gravity, low temperature, ...).  "Mission of Gravity", "Needle"
and "The Best of Hal Clement" are all ones I've read and can recommend.
But (as with many hard SF authors), his prose style can grate.
Reportedly, his latest efforts show improvement.

Edited: 8-Oct-93

I tend to look upon D. G. Compton as a late arrival in the "British let's
destroy the world in interesting ways" school of the late 50's and early
60's.  Original members include John Wyndham, John Christopher and J. G.
Ballard.  The stories I've read have all taken place in the near future
with people coping with a decaying social environment.  The emphasis is
very much on the characters of the story.  Ones I liked were "The Steel
Crocodile" [on the dangers of technical progress] and "Chronocules" [a
time-travel story].

John Crowley, on the other hand, writes wonderful, intricate, rewarding
SF.  For me, his only peer for sheer prose style in SF today is Gene
Wolfe.  But, while Gene Wolfe's prose is just wonderful to behold, John
Crowley has a marvelous deceptive clarity.  It's always readable.  I'm
caught up in the story, hardly noticing how I'm being carried along.  But
later, on closer examination, the harder I look, the deeper it gets.  For
the beginning reader, I'd recommend "Engine Summer", a marvelous story
that's still very approachable.  To me, however, "Little, Big" is his best
work, dealing with many marvelous, quirky characters, the modern world and
the land of Faery.  It does take some some effort to complete, but is
entirely worth it.  I'm still not quite sure what to make of "AEgypt".
Part of it is probably my obtuseness (and I've only read it once), part of
it is that fact that it's not complete: there is going to a couple more
books to complete the story.  All of his books deserve to be read.

Subject: Author Lists: Roald Dahl
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 10-Jul-93

Roald (pronounced "Roo-aal") Dahl writes two different types of stories:
his adult and his children's stories.  His adult stories are generally
Alfred Hitchcock mixed with a dash of the Twilight Zone.  Witty, macabre,
and with a surprise ending, they are great reads that often contain some
fantasy element.

His children's books aren't that far from his adult novels.  Although
written for children, they have a wicked sense of humor that real children
find delightful.  I am reminded of the cartoons of Charles Addams, or (to
a lesser degree) Edward Gorey.  His most famous work, "Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory" was successfully filmed as "Willy Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory" (even if the film was slightly sanitized).  And "The
Witches" was recently filmed (to be released shortly in the U.S.A.) and I
look forward to seeing it.  Another favorite is "George's Marvelous
Medicine", for very few authors would let George do what he does (no
spoilers).

Many of you may be more familiar with Peter David as a comic book writer.
(Currently working on "The Hulk", "Star Trek", & "The Atlantis Chronicles"
among others).  But he has written a number of SF books.  "Knight Life"
was an amusing fantasy with King Arthur(tm) returning and running for
Mayor of New York.  I also liked his two Star Trek: The Next Generation
novels, with "A Rock And A Hard Place" being the more successful of the
two.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

I've always preferred Avram Davidson's short stories to his novels.  His
novels (particularly the later ones) meander a bit too much for my taste
(even though they are extremely well written).  His short stories are
always witty, literate & amusing.  My favorite short story is "Or All the
Seas with Oysters", which deals with the issue of why one always has more
coat hangers than one thought.

Edited: 6-Apr-94

Samuel Delany writes in the literary realm of SF.  His earlier stories (up
until "Nova") are well written, have vivid images, and reasonably
traditional plot structures.  Then he spent several years writing some
amazing short stories ("Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious
Stones" & "Aye, and Gomorrah").  Then he produced "Dhalgren".  "Dhalgren"
produces few ambivalent readers, people either love it or hate it.  (I
didn't particularly like it when I read it 5 years ago, but I'll have to
give it another shot to see if my tastes have changed).  Since then he's
done several academic works on SF, written on the "Sword & Sorcery" series
of Neveryon & produced "Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand" [the
sequel of which still isn't out].

Edited: 5-Feb-94

Lester del Rey is probable winner of the longest original name in SF.
I've only read the "The Best of Lester Del Rey", but it had some very good
tales.  "Helen O'Loy" & "Hereafter, Inc" are both memorable.  He's also
important to the field as an editor, first in various magazines then
fantasy editor at Ballantine then editor of Del Rey books.

A word about those "Collaborations".  I've read descriptions of these
books ranging from "it was completely ghost written by Paul Fairman" to
"Paul Fairman wrote it from an outline created by Lester del Rey" to "they
were co-writers".   The exact degree of collaboration probably varied from
book to book.

Thanks to Jeff Deifik for adding the Glimmung novel and the two
unpublished novels (which I'll take on faith).  Also added is the mixed
collection "The Dark-Haired Girl" (both fiction and non-fiction [primarily
letters]) which was just published.

+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+==+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

There are some authors that I just *KNOW* someone is going to ask about.
Philip K. Dick heads the list.   And for good reason.  Philip K. Dick is a
great author (who admittedly has written some mediocre books).  He largely
dealt with the questions of reality: subjective, religious, quasi,
psychotic & drug induced.  One should never be too sure what is "really"
happening in a Dick novel.  Good books for the beginning Dick reader are
The Man in the High Castle, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  (made
into the movie "Bladerunner"), and Eye in the Sky.

And incidently, I have no more pending requests for lists.  So unless I
get requests for more authors, you'll have to be content with the 27
authors I've done already.

[C] == Story Collection.
[CB] == Chapbook (a very short book, or pamphlet).
[YA] == The book is for young adults (however you define them).
[O] == Omnibus.  Includes other books.

Peter Dickinson has a name for himself in the mystery genre as well as
SF.  I've only read his "Changes" trilogy, a good juvenile series where
almost everyone in England develops a sudden loathing of machines.  Note
that you should read them in the reverse order that they were published,
that's the way the internal chronology works.

Edited: 10-Mar-94

Gordy Dickson is another author mostly famous for one series, in this case
it's the Dorsai.  I like this series, the earlier ones in particular (I
haven't read The Chantry Guild yet, but felt that The Final Encyclopedia
could have easily been cut in half).  I would like to see some more
attention on the other exotic peoples sometime.

Aside from that, you'll notice that he's had many collections released in
the last few years.  These are generally composed of stories from the 50's
and 60's.  In terms of his other work, I can recommend Time Storm, Way of
the Pilgrim, & The Hoka Stories (incredibly silly but fun).

Thomas Disch was a regular voice in the British "New Wave" of the 1960's.
His short stories of the period reflect the strengths and weaknesses of
that movement.  I've read one of his novels, "Camp Concentration", which
is a strong examination of experimentally (and leathally) raising the
intelligence of political prisoners.

Well, Mr.Donaldson has been discussed to death here recently, so I won't
belabor the issue.  I've read his first two trilogies (some of you may
have noticed that I'm an omnivourous reader) and while the setting was
interesting, Thomas Covenant was an incredible twit and his misusage of
long, obscure words just got to me after a while (and the second trilogy
felt padded).  So I've never felt the urge to try his more recent works.

Yea, yea. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the guy who wrote Sherlock Holmes.
But like many working writers of the late 19th / early 20th centuries, he
wrote in a number of different fields.  He wrote a number of works in the
realms of adventure tales, historical romances and science fiction.  His
best overtly SF is the Professor Challenger stories.  "The Lost World",
while not wonderfully written, tells the story of an egocentric scientist
who discovers a lost plateau in South America where neanderthals and
dinosaurs live side by side.  Rather fun if you have a taste for the
adventure stories of the era.

Dave Learn recently asked for all the Doctor Who books.  Since this is a
slightly different request from the standard 1 author list, I've had to
use a different format.  The #'s are the series number defined by the

Subject: Author Lists: Diane Duane
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 3-Nov-93

I've really enjoyed all of Diane Duane's work, and there is very few
authors I can say that about.  "So You Want to Be a Wizard" contains a
really great alternate New York that makes so much sense, that personally,
I'm not sure that it's completely alternate (complete with killer taxis,
menacing subway cars, intelligent rats, and a dragon in the subway).
She's one of the top quality Star Trek novelists (an honor she shares with
John M. Ford).  And her Door into XXX series is a fantasy where the
setting (magic, theology, politics) is not just window dressing, but is
necessary for the entire story. Her other work includes (flip, flip. flip)
stories in some of the later THIEVES' WORLD anthologies (#6 and above),
several issues of the STAR TREK comic book, some TV cartoon stories, and
a computer game (Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative).

[YA] == The book is for young adults (however you define them).
[O] == Omnibus.  Includes other books.

Subject: Author Lists: Lord Dunsany
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 8-Oct-93

Lord Dunsany is one of the great late 19th / early 20th century fantasy
writers that wrote before J. R. R. Tolkien forever changed the field of
fantasy.  (I'd put William Morris & George MacDonald in the same
company).  Aside from being a major writer of fantasy, he was a big-game
hunter, world-class chess player & playwright.

The prose of Lord Dunsany is different from modern usage, but by no means
impossible  (I personally find E. R. Eddison, Mervyn Peake & Clarke Ashton
Smith harder to read).  The best place to start would be "The King of
Elfland's Daughter", a marvelous story of a King who falls in love with a
Faery Princess, loves & loses her & then tries to find her again.  The
interweaving of the descriptions of Faery with mundane reality is
especially effective.

And for people interested in early fantasy, the best place to start would
be the "Ballantine Adult Fantasy" series.  A group of books selected by
Lin Carter in late 60's to early 70's is now hard to find (my collection
is now 80% complete), but contains some really good material.

David Eddings has only written in two worlds (excluding a deer hunting
related novel a decade earlier).  Sure all his characters are stereotypes,
and his plots are very much standard quests, but he manages to make it
massively entertaining with some surprises lurking when one doesn't expect
them.

I have only read one of George Alec Effinger's books: "When Gravity

cyberpunk.  Someone with his talent has probably written many worthwhile

The Coyote Jones series and the Ozark series were originally completely
separate.  The two series do meet in 'Yonder Comes the Other End of
Time'.   I've read 'Native Tongue', the background is ridiculous (an
amendment to the  US constitution caused total loss of women's rights
world wide?), and the  anti-male attitude is too strident, but the
linguistics were interesting.

Subject: Author Lists: Harlan Ellison
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 10-Mar-94

Harlan Ellison tends to provoke strong reactions.  People either strongly
like or dislike his works (or, for that matter, the man himself).  He
has, however, won a large number of awards (several outside SF, including
the Edgar by the Mystery Writers of America).  I personally enjoy his
work, but only if I'm in a particular mood.  Ellison (like Gene Wolfe or
Stanislaw Lem) is someone that I must have the correct mental attitude to
really enjoy (This isn't mind candy, it a full meal).  I've always been
particularly fond of "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" & "Deathbird
Stories", but "The Essential Ellison" provides the best overview of his
entire work.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

I tend to like Farmer's single works over his series. The first
Riverworld was intriguing, but it quickly started to drag.  The Lovers
is an groundbreaking treatment of sex in SF.  (as is A Woman a Day,
Image of the Beast and A Feast Unknown).  And The Unreasoning Mask must
be entered into the
"my-alien-artifact-is-infinitely-more-complex-than-your-alien-artifact
contest.   A favorite topic is telling the "true" story behind someone
else's novel.  (Oz, Tarzan, Verne, Doc Savage, Moby Dick, Kilgore Trout,
and Sherlock Holmes).

I'm now going to do some easy authors people have requested.  Easy
because (1) I own all (or virtually all) of their works & (2) they are
all recent writers.

John M. Ford is a good writer.  I've enjoyed every one of his books
(although his second book is a bit weak).  "The Dragon Waiting" is a
great alternate history.  "The Final Reflection" is the definitive novel
on Klingons & "How Much for Just the Planet?" is **FUNNY** (both for
people who like and people who dislike trek).  All we need is a lot more
novels!

I've never read any of Gardner F. Fox's work.  He's probably as well known

His novel "Escape Across the Cosmos" is perhaps unique in that it was
plagiarized twice by the same person and sold to two different publishers!

Esther Friesner does some of the better light fantasy today (and her best
stuff has considerable meat on it).  It ranges from oriental style fantasy
[The Chronicles of the Twelve Kingdoms], spaced out alternate history
[Druid's Blood] to interesting contemporary situations [New York by
Knight, etc.].  I'm not a big fan of her Demon series, nor her other two
unconnected books [The Harlot's Ruse & The Silver Mountain].  What I'd
like to know is if she's ever going to continue her Chronicles of the
Twelve Kingdoms series.  It was the first stuff she published, it had an
interesting setting, and it wasn't left in a good stopping point.  Twelve
books were planned, but I haven't heard anything recently.

Many of his devastating pastiches of other SF writers can be found in

scientific-magic mystery Lord Darcy books ["Too Many Magicians" is highly
recommended].  Plus the ~200 uncollected short stories from the 50's,

Yea, Yea, Yea.  I know.  But I've been quite busy the last month or two.
There is regrettably little money in SF bibliography.

And here are the books written by David Gerrold.  He's probably most
famous for his Star Trek work (author of "The Trouble with Tribbles").
He's also done a number of fine straight SF novels.  "When HARLEY was One"
is fairly good in the Computer-becomes-sentient sub-genre.  "The Man Who
Folded Himself" is an excellent reducto ad absurdium on the paradoxes of
time travel. "The Flying Sorcerers" is great fun (how many SF references
can you spot?)  And at long last, his Chtorr series is starting up again
(yea!!.  Now if Meredith Ann Pierce would finish her Darkangel trilogy
I'd be much happier).

For someone with only 3 novels and 1 story collection, William Gibson has
certainly made a mark in SF.  If you want a deep discussion on cyberpunk,
there's an entire newsgroup devoted to it (alt.cyberpunk).  Personally, I
find William Gibson to be a marvelous writer, with mixed reviews for the
wannabe cyberpunkers.  But by all means read the original, "Neuromancer"
is the best starting place.

I've read two Parke Godwin books: _Waiting for the Galactic Bus_ & _The
Snake Oil Wars_.  Both are wonderfully biting satires, dealing with the
issues of religion (American Christianity in particular) and modern
society from the viewpoint of two aliens stuck on Earth for the last
couple of million years.  These two are responsible for the current
evolution of man, and are currently in charge of the two areas of the
afterlife: Topside and Below Stairs.

James Gunn really seems to like one word titles (well two words if you
count "The").  His only book that I've read is "The Immortals", basis of
the TV series.  The series only covered the first 1/3 of the book, where
a mega-millionaire discovers that one individual (and possibly his
relatives) has blood that keeps him immortal (immune to disease and
aging).  The rest of the book carried the idea much further, where all of
medical science and research is directed to the prolongation of life to
the few who can afford it.  He's also done a good anthology series on the
history of science fiction (The Road to Science Fiction, volumes 1 to 4
"From Gilgamesh to Wells", "From Wells to Heinlein", "From Heinlein to
Here" and "From Here to Forever") and a couple of non-fiction science
fiction related books.

Another good fantasy author.  I personally like her "Unschooled Wizard"
series, "Ishmael" [one of the two intentionally silly trek novels] &
"Those Who Hunt the Night" [a nice, atmospheric vampire novel].  Her
Darwath Trilogy is also recommended.

Edmond Hamilton was one of the original space opera hacks, known as "World
Destroyer/Saver" Hamilton.  (Hack being used in the purely good sense).
If you have a taste for this sort of thing, it's all in good fun, even if
his work hasn't aged as well as E. E. ''Doc" Smith.  Towards the end of
his career he did write several much more "literary" short stories, many
of which are collected in "The Best of Edmond Hamilton".

Ah, Zenna Henderson.  She was one of the best writers at portraying
believable, three dimensional children.  This was probably due to being a
school teacher for a number of years.  Her best known stories deal with
"The People", a group of alien humans who fled the destruction of the
world and are now living hidden on Earth.  These aliens have psychic
abilities and how they interact with normal humanity forms the core of
most of these stories.  These stories also formed the basis for an O.K.
film "The People" [1971] starring Kim Darby and William Shatner.

And for those of us who have already read all of her books (which aren't
that hard to find), there are a few uncollected stories. They include:

 "Thrumthing and Out", Fantasy & Science Fiction Magazine, 10/72
 "The First Stroke", Fantasy & Science Fiction Magazine, 10/77
 "There Was a Garden", _Cassandra Rising_ [1978], edited by Alice Laurance
 "Tell Us a Story", Fantasy & Science Fiction Magazine, 10/80 (also appears
    in _The Best SF of the Year #10_ [1981], edited by Terry Carr)

I just *KNEW* that someone would ask for Frank Herbert eventually.  Of
course, he's most famous for "Dune".  The consensus opinion is that the
series went into a serious decline after the first book.  Well, I started
reading Frank Herbert when I picked up "Dune Messiah".  I quickly finished
it, said that was good, let's look for some more, proceeded to read
"Children of Dune" and then "Dune", and then read the entire series in the
correct order.   Overall, I'd rate "Dune Messiah" (the first one I read
and enjoyed) as the weakest of the three.  Not because it's a bad book,
just that it pales in comparison with "Dune".  And aside from "Dune", the
Frank Herbert book I'd recommend would be his first novel: "Under
Pressure", a fine psychological novel set in a submarine.

Any fan of H. P. Lovecraft should read _The House on the Borderland_.
It's an effective story that anticipates much of Lovecraft's style.
Personally, I even find it better written.  William Hope Hodgson also
has written a lot in the admittedly small sub-genre of sea SF stories.

Edited: 15-Apr-94

I've read a couple of Robert Holdstock novels that were pretty good. But
they didn't prepare me for how wonderful "Mythago Wood" would be.  This
book explores a couple of acres of England forest that's the remnant of
the original primeval woods.  It turns out to be much larger on the inside
than on the outside, and is populated with the original mythological
creatures of human history.  Myths have been greatly sanitised over the
years, the inhabitants are much more dangerous and capricious than most
would expect. I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel "Lavondyss" to come out
in paperback.  (I almost never by hardcovers.  At the rate that I buy
books, it's not economically feasible).

Subject: Author Lists: Robert E. Howard
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 5-Feb-94

A Robert E. Howard book list is difficult (but not as bad as H. P.
Lovecraft).  Virtually all of his books were published after his death,
and many of them are the result of posthumous collaborations or editing.
And then there are all the books that were written by other people based
on his characters.  And most of the books are limited printings from
small publishers, re-shuffling the limited body of work.  (Also, I've
probably missed several books between 1977 and 1985, where there is a gap
in my references).

With those limits, here it is:

[C] == Story Collection.

Fred Hoyle not only has a respectable career in hard SF, but is a noted

state cosmology model).  As might be expected, most of his novels feature
ideas drawn on the hard sciences, astronomy in particular.  "The Black

L. Ron Hubbard had some fame in the 30's and 40's as a pulp SF writer.
Reportedly his best book of the period was "Typewriter in the Sky".  Since
then he founded Dianetics, made megabuck, and even published a new SF

D. F. Jones is most famous for the novel "Colossus".  It was later filmed
as "Colossus: The Forbin Project".  The film is a credible adaption of
the book.  Both versions tell the story of a super-computer that goes from
control of Western nuclear defenses to taking control of the world.  It's
a logically presented with an opressive atmosphere of things happening
beyond human control.  It's recommended, although my all time favorite
story in the "computers taking over" genre is still Jack Williamson's
"With Folded Hands" story & "The Humanoids" novel.

This was too easy to pass up.  I haven't read any of his works, but yes,
all five books have been published.  In addition, there are about 7
uncollected Jameson stories, plus about another 22 uncollected stories in
other settings.  You're on your own trying to find a copy of the books,
however.  (And for the really interested, the list of which stories are
in the books can be found in "The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and

in "Twentieth Century Science-Fiction Writers (2nd Edition)" by Curtis

I'm a great fan of well done "juveniles".  A juvenile can have anything an
adult book can have (except for wild sex).  The prose is seldom as
intricate as other adult novels, but that means that it can be clearer,
more direct, without the complications adult life can impose on
situations.  Diana Wynne Jones (together with Margaret Mahy, Jane Yolen,
and Daniel Pinkwater (for humor) are among my favorite "juvenile" authors.
I'd especially recommend the "Chrestomanci" books as well as "Fire and
Hemlock" [an excellent retelling of Tam Lin].

Subject: Author Lists: James Kahn
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: rec.arts.sf.written

The only James Kahn I've read is the "New World" trilogy.  The first
novel is a very good novel set in a unique future.  It contains all
manner of  fantasy creatures: vampires, centaurs, griffins, dragons,
hobbits, giant butterflies and other myths and legends, but the story
is Science Fiction (not Fantasy).  I'll leave out the rationale to
avoid spoilers.  The story concerns the quest of a human scribe and a
centaur trying to find their kidnapped family.  The second book is a
continuation of the first.  When I first heard their was going to be a
third one, I said "no way".  The end of the second leaves absolutely no
room for a standard sequel.  And _Time Fall_ is not a standard sequel.
It continues the story and has several of the same characters
(sort-of), but in a weird way.  Still, I think the entire trilogy is
worth reading.

Guy Gavriel Kay has only done one trilogy.  But it's a GREAT trilogy.
This can best be described as high fantasy.  What distinguishes this is
not the fine prose, or interesting characters (since several series have
these), but rather a genuine sense of tragedy.  Many books talk about
fated characters, but these demonstrate them.  It's also joyous and shows
the importance of choice.  The third book STILL isn't out in paperback
(some legal difficulties), but is worth getting in hardcover.

I rather like _The Doppleganger Gambit_.  It has a very interesting
near future *texture*.  It a police procedural novel set in the 21st
century.  The police are called LEOs (Law Enforcement Officers), and
all sorts of little details flow out of this (walking into a bar, the
patrons call "here pussy, pussy, pussy").  A neat world.  The other
books in the series are OK, but don't have the same freshness of the
first.

Everyone should have at least *heard* of Stephen King.  He's the
top-selling horror writer today.  Personally, I'm not a big horror fan (I
prefer SF or Fantasy), but I have read a couple of his books.  His books
are well plotted, with real contemporary characters and really great
pacing (although I've found some of his later books to be too long).  My
favorite Stephen King work is "The Mist", a truly scary short novel.

Edited: 7-May-94

Damon Knight was the first significant critic in the field of SF.  "In
Search of Wonder" contains his ground-breaking essays.  He has also done
dozens of excellent anthologies (being  one of the best editors of the
60's & early 70's).  The original "Orbit" anthologies (1 to 21) are
especially good.   I've never any of his novels, but I've enjoyed what
I've read of his short stories.  Most familiar to net readers would be
"To Serve Man" (basis of the Twilight Zone episode).

Dean Koontz actually wrote a fair amount of SF from 1968 to 1975 under his
own name.  Since that time (and under a variety of aliases), he's written
mostly Horror.  Personally, I don't like horror; but I know that many
people here do enjoy it.  (Exactly how the circles of Horror, SF and
Fantasy intersect in a Venn diagram, and how to tell them apart is a
complex topic in itself).  Since horror isn't my thing, be warned that
this list may be incomplete, especially for recent years or for unknown
pseudonyms.

Personally, the pacing of _The Golden Grove_ drove me crazy.  It just
didn't go anywhere.  And the trip wasn't that interetesting.  I liked
_An Alien Light_ a lot more.  A human population on a marginal planet
are ignorant of their origins and are being studied by the aliens
running the place.  A nice piece of SF speculation.  I particularly
liked the classification of all known species and why humans were
different.

I've read three Michael Kurland books: "Perchance", a decent
cross-alternate-universes chase story, and the two 'Lord Darcy' books.
They really don't stack up to the original Randall Garrett material, but
they were OK.  I personally prefered the second one, because it took the
Randall Garrett characters and then placed them in a completely new
situation (which lessens the problem of comparisons).

Subject: Author Lists: Henry Kuttner
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 26-Jun-93

Someone asked me to do a list of Henry Kuttner books.  There's a problem
with that.  All work done between 1940 and 1958 by either Henry Kuttner or
C. L. Moore (they were married) was in some degree a collaboration.
Sometimes the partner wasn't credited, sometimes they were, and most
often they used a pseudonym (Lewis Padgett begin the most popular of
many). A bibliographer could go crazy trying to properly separate the
credit on all the books.  I'm not willing to go that far.  So I'm giving
you two book lists for the price of one.  I'm breaking down the list by
who was listed as the author on the book.  Be aware that it was probably
a collaboration.

That being said, Kuttner & Moore were great writers. One of the major
reasons they used so many pseudonyms was to avoid filling an issue of
some SF magazine with their stories.  And such great stories!  Vintage
Season, Mimsy Were the Borogoves, The Proud Robot, The Twonky, No Woman
Born and Shambleau.

engaging fantasy with a very good ear to characterization.  Highly
recommended to fantasy fans.

R. A. Lafferty has an ODD sense of humor.  Probably the best description
would be a tall tale.  I personally enjoyed "Past Master", but have been
frequently at a loss with some of his other stories.  A large number of
his books are really pamphlets published by Chris Drumm.  Worth trying to
see if one matches his humor.

Edited: 9-Aug-93

Keith Laumer has actually written far less Retief stories than it appears
by a simple book count.  If you take a bunch of old stories, and publish
a set of them that haven't been published together before, you have a new
story collection!  If the publishers are feeling nice, they may add one
new story.  Baen books has been grossly guilty of this during the last
few years.  The books with two copywrite dates generally was published
the second time with all the old material plus a new story or two.

Subject: Author Lists: Ursula Le Guin
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 11-Mar-94

In the late 60's & early 70's, Ursula K Le Guin wrote some truly amazing
SF novels.  "The Left Hand of Darkness", "The Dispossessed", "The Earthsea
Trilogy", & "The Lathe of Heaven" are all wonderful works that I highly
recommend.  Since that time, she's been working on scholarly essays on the
nature of SF, several juveniles, and the occasional SF short story.
"Always Coming Home" is an odd work, it can probably be be explained as
speculative, future archeology.

William Fitzgerald Jenkins (better known as Murray Leinster) had a long
and varied career.  He started writing SF in 1919 and continued to write
until his death in 1975.  He also had several books published in the
mystery and western genres.  He wrote in all the different types of SF
during the "Golden Age" and a number of his works are still readable
today.  I have a special fondness for his Med series & "The Best of
Murray Leinster" is a good collection of his short stories.

To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 26-Jun-93

Lem is probably the best SF writer not writing in english (although good
cases could be made for Borges, Calvino or Strugatsky).  Here are his
books that have been translated into english, plus an unconfirmed listing
of his books that have not been translated yet (take this later list with
a large grain of salt).

Lem has written a broad range of works, from disturbingly serious
(Solaris) to slapstick (Tales of Pirx the Pilot).  He's used some odd
forms (reviews of non-existent books).  He has serious criticisms of
western SF, saying it's too often used for action/adventure instead of
serious imaginative works.  In a Lem books, aliens are REALLY alien
(incomprehensible).

Edited: 23-Jun-93

Another excellent juvenile writer.  Most of her books (both SF and
non-SF) are set in the same universe, following the adventures of a few
families over several generations.  Because of this inter-connectedness,
I've included most all of her fiction.  By far her most famous work is "A
Wrinkle in Time", which I give my full recommendation.  None of her other
work I've read, however, managed to capture the same magic as the first.

Edited: 18-Jun-93

C. S. Lewis is one of the few people to write Christian SF.  The message
occasionally go in the way of the story, but not as often as one might
fear ("The Last Battle" is probably the worst).  But I rather like them,
they certainly have a different flavor to most other SF.  Try "The Lion,
the Witch and the Wardrobe" if you like a well written juvenile, or "Out
of the Silent Planet" for Christian space opera.  "The Screwtape Letters"
is also an amusing set of letters between a minor devil trying to tempt
humanity and his boss.

I've enjoyed all of Megan Lindholm's work, but far and away her best work
is "The Wizard of the Pigeons".  It's a contemporary urban fantasy (you
know, the kind of story that Charles de Lint does so well).  The setting
is Seattle and the characters are homeless people with "magical"
abilities.  And, of course, there's a battle between good and evil.  It's
extremely well done story & characters that I recommend.  Then you can
try some of her other stuff.

This list almost certainly has several omissions (sorry gang).  The
problem is that Brian Lumley is a horror writer, and if you thought
trying to separate SF from main stream is bad, try separating SF from
horror.  As a result, the coverage of horror writers in my references is
(at best) spotty.  Anyone with corrections (Lovecraft fans in particular)
is welcome to submit them.

That being said, it's my understanding that much of Brian Lumley's stories
(his earlier work in particular) is in a Lovecraftian vein.  I've never
read any of his books myself.

Elizabeth Lynn is an excellent writer who seems to have vanished off the
face of the SF world.  She does quite good SF ("A Different Light" and
"The Sardonyx Net"), but I prefer her fantasy trilogy.  And it really is a
trilogy.  Each book develops a world situation, and then resolves it.  The
next book takes place ~100 years later, where the consequences of the
previous book have developed to their logical conclusion, and the people
of the previous books are a hazy story, if remembered at all.  All of her
books have a rich mixture of elements: characterization, plot and setting.
Does anyone know what she's doing right now?

Edited: 5-Feb-94

R. A. MacAvoy burst on the SF scene a few years ago with the utterly
charming "Tea With the Black Dragon".  She then went on to produce a very
good fantasy: The Damiano Trilogy.  The nice points of this series are the
setting (Renaissance Italy) and the plot.  Not to produce any spoilers,
but very few authors would try what she did in the end of the second and
all through the third book.  I don't think it was completely successful,
but I enjoy authors *TRYING*, even if they don't always succeed.  Her next
few books just didn't work for me, although they were all well written,
and there are many who like them.  Her latest, "The Third Eagle" is
Science Fiction (all her previous works have been Fantasy of some flavor)
looks interesting, and I'm looking forward to reading it when it comes out
in paperback (I buy far too many books to afford hardcovers).

Subject: Author Lists: George MacDonald
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 5-Jul-93

Of the many George MacDonald fantasies, five are consistently in print:
the two Curdie books, "At the Back of The North Wind", "Phantastes" &
"Lilith".  I've only read the two Curdie stories and "Phantastes", even
though I own all five plus "Evenor".  (Regular readers will recognize
that I'm a sucker for a well told juvenile).  The Curdie books are good
classic fairy tales of a princess, a miner's son in a magical country of
goblins and evil monsters.  "Phantastes" was tougher going, being a young
man's journey of self-discovery through Faerie (I have a mild allergy to
allegory).

Edited: 9-Feb-94

I've always felt that George R. R. Martin excels in the short story.
He's written a couple of good novels (I liked "Fevre Dream" and "The
Armageddon Rag"), but he's written several really great short stories.
"A Song for Lya", "The Way of Cross and Dragon" and "Sandkings" are
really great and I highly recommend them.  In other fields, he's
currently some high muckey-muck (story editor?) in the TV series "Beauty
and the Beast".  He's also in charge of (coordinator is probably a better
term than editor) in the best shared world anthology going: "Wild Cards".
It deals with the effects of having comic-book-like heroes in the real
world.  The mechanism is an alien virus that kills 90% of it's victims,
gives horrible changes to 9% (the Jokers) and gives super-hero powers to
1% (the Aces).  The first book was a wonderful introduction into the
world.  The second book was the weakest in the series, but it picked up
from there.  I'm really looking forward to book six (which will take place
in the 1988 Democratic Presidential Convention, and lots of changes are
rumored to take place).

Subject: Author Lists: Richard Matheson
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: rec.arts.sf.written
Edited: 11-Mar-94

Richard Matheson is one of the most cinematic SF writers.  A number of
his books have been made into films: Somewhere in Time, I am Legend
(filmed as The Last Man on Earth and as The Omega Man, Hellhouse (filmed
as The Legend of Hell House) and The Incredible Shrinking Man.  I think
that Hellhouse (both the book and movie version) makes an interesting
contrast with Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House (filmed as The
Haunting).  Both deal with a team of psychics investigating a powerful
haunted house.  Both are wonderful books with excellent movie adaptions,
but they have completely different approaches.  Matheson's story is a
very scientific investigation while Jackson's story is more of a moody
psychological piece.

In addition to his books, Matheson has written extensively for TV (many
Twilight Zones, a Star Trek, The Night Stalker, Duel, Night Gallery and
many others) and Movies (several of his own books, several Poe adaptions
for Roger Corman, a Twilight Zone segment, and others).

Edited: 18-Mar-94

Julian May writes for a cast of thousands.  Her stories have scope.  Her
first series dealt with galactic civilizations, time travel, alien
invasions of the earth, and psychic powers in all varieties.  I think
that the vast number of characters got away from her towards the end of
her first series (what were the dozen main characters doing at the end?),
but she seems to have gotten this under control with her most recent
work.  Be warned that her stories do take time start, so give them more
than 50 pages to grab you.

Patricia McKillip has been writing SF longer than most people realize.
Personally, I feel that her prose and storytelling abilities are better
utilized in her fantasy than in her SF.  Her riddle master trilogy is
great, even if it does border on the cute  ("Air of Sea & Fire"?  Come
on).  Her stuff is definitely recommended for all fantasy fans.

Edited: 8-Oct-93

A. Merritt's prose style is about as "ornate" as I can enjoy,  But I do
like his work.  My favorite is his least typical, "The Ship of Ishtar".
It's his one pure fantasy (his others were at least marginally SF when
they were written).  It's the story of an archeologist transported to an
alternate world of Babylonian mythology.  I also like "The Metal Monster"
and "Dwellers in the Mirage", which are interesting "lost race" type
stories.  The first is concerns an alien race of metallic, hive-like
beings in the Himalayas, and the second is about a hidden valley in
Alaska and it's unique life.  Worth a try to see if it's to your taste.

I found the first Skyrider book to be a good lightweight space-opera,
where the heros are amazingly competent.  As with most such series,
however, the later books do tend to go downhill.  People who like that
sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like.  Space-opera
fans should try the first.

Nope, I'm sorry this list does not contain any of Michael Moorcock's songs
or his short stories.  It does contain one directly relevant anthology
though (other authors writing with one of his characters).  Most all of
his works fit into this huge framework called the eternal champion cycle.
For bibliographers, he has this nasty habit of revising editions without
warning, and having an interlocking cast of characters that make the
relationship between books impossible to simply show.

I rather like him, his Sword & Sorcery particularly (the first 5 series
listed).  I never could get into the Jerry Cornelius stories, that
particular prose style always sets my teeth on edge.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

Someone asked me to do a list of Henry Kuttner books.  There's a problem
with that.  All work done between 1940 and 1958 by either Henry Kuttner or
C. L. Moore (they were married) was in some degree a collaboration.
Sometimes the partner wasn't credited, sometimes they were, and most
often they used a pseudonym (Lewis Padgett begin the most popular of
many). A bibliographer could go crazy trying to properly separate the
credit on all the books.  I'm not willing to go that far.  So I'm giving
you two book lists for the price of one.  I'm breaking down the list by
who was listed as the author on the book.  Be aware that it was probably
a collaboration.

That being said, Kuttner & Moore were great writers. One of the major
reasons they used so many pseudonyms was to avoid filling an issue of
some SF magazine with their stories.  And such great stories!  Vintage
Season, Mimsy Were the Borogoves, The Proud Robot, The Twonky, No Woman
Born and Shambleau.

Daniel Keys Moran is one of the top new names in SF.  The three books I've
read have all been nicely written, fast paced, enjoyable books.  You won't
go wrong reading any of them.  The one novel I haven't read is "The Ring".
From what I understand (and I could be wrong) it's a science fiction
novelization of a Chinese film based on Wagner's "Ring der Niebelungen".
Also, in no way confuse Daniel Keys Moran with Daniel Moran (a pseudonym
of Robert Vardeman, "The Keys to Paradise" trilogy).  Daniel Keys Moran is a
*much* better writter.

William Morris is one of the important late 19th / early 20th century
fantasy writers.  Lord Dunsany and George MacDonald are two others.  He
was one of the first to set his fantasies in a completely imaginary
world.  Her prose style is purposefully archaic, but for those with a
taste for it, his books are wonderful.  Good place to start would be
_The Water of the Wondrous Isles_ or _The Well at the World's End_.

And here is another comparatively short list: Larry Niven.  I really like
his stories. "All the Myriad Ways" is classic, must read, *****

Oh, and before you Niven fans get all worked up about a few story
collections you haven't seen before:

"The Shape of Space" is long out of print, but the stories are in "Tales
of Known Space" & "Convergent Series"

The same goes for "Inconstant Moon", with the added twist that it was
only a british edition.

"Time of the Warlock" is a illustrated book from a small press publisher,
and therefore is impossible to find.

Subject: Author Lists: Andre Norton
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 11-Mar-94

To the best of my knowledge, Andre Norton has never won a major award for
fiction (although she has had two Hugo nominations).  Paradoxically, she
has won every Life-Achievement award given in SF.  This illustrates that
the body of Andre Norton's work is more important than any particular
story.  The first book DAW published was a Witch World novel.  The first
book Tor published was "Forerunner"

Probably as many kids have gotten hooked on SF by reading a Norton
story as reading any other author (Heinlein is probably tied for this
honor).  Virtually all of her characters must go through some rite of
passage, making her work appealing to juveniles.  Personally, I really
like Norton's work.  In her books, science and technology always take a
back seat to plot and character.  And while she isn't a great prose
stylist, her style is effective in presenting her story.  And to me,
Andre Norton is a great *STORY-TELLER*.

She writes both SF and Fantasy, and her stories are set in a wide variety
of settings, aliens, cultures and technologies.  Her most famous fantasy
work is the Witch World series.  This divides into two separate cycles:
Halleck & Estcarp.  I prefer the Estcarp stories myself.

Although Witch World is better known, most of her SF is science fiction.
And most of her science fiction is space opera (in the best possible
sense):  men bravely exploring the outer reaches of the galaxy, finding
strange artifacts, meeting alien races and struggling against
overwhelming odds.  While her many  SF books aren't really part of a
single series, they do share a common background:  The rise and fall of
the human galactic empire, where many alien races co-exist and the ruins
of other, older empires ("Forerunners") are scattered with odd and

the non-SF are historical fiction with no obvious fantastic element.  A
number of these have been marketed as SF anyway (If C. J. Cherryh's "The

fantasy, I can include Andre Norton's historical novels in my listing).

Alan Nourse is probably most famous for providing the title (but
nothing else) to the movie _Balderunner_.  In actuallity, his novel
_The Blade Runner_ is about smuggling illegal medical supply where
medical care was tightly controlled by the government.  Gun Runner /
Blade Runner, get it?  Most of his work had some medical element.  The
fact that Alan Nourse was a practicing doctor helped give his work a
basis of reality.

Kevin O'Donnell Jr. (not to be confused with K. M. O'Donnell, a pseudonym
used by Barry Malzberg in the late 60's - early 70's) is one of those
frustrating authors who vanish for years at a time.  His best work is the
McGill Feighan series, with the protagonist maturing believably in the
last few novels & several mysteries that are slowing being revealed.
Ora:Cle (about a computer network) is a sentimental favorite of mine.

I've really liked the two Edgar Pangborn novels I've read.  "Davy" is a
bawdy, Tom Jones-ish novel set after a post nuclear holocaust.  "A Mirror
for Observers" is a marvelous tale of extra-terrestrial observers who must
decide between watching and and actively intervening in Earth culture.
Both these have wonderful characterizations & quite good prose.  I'll
have to read some more more Pangborn.

_Rite of Passage_ is one of the best Heinlein juveniles that was not
actually written by Robert Heinlein.  I also found his Anthony Villiers
books to be wonderfully entertaining comedy of manners, with heavy
emphasis on style and witty cynical observations on the human
condition.  A fourth Anthony Villiers novel was announced in the early
70's (_The Universal Pantograph_), but this is one of those "lost"
books that will never be seen by the eyes of man.

Daniel Pinkwater has a weird sense of humor, but I like him.  He
definitely writes kids books, but like the best of them (e.g. Dr. Seuss
or Rocky & Bulwinkle cartoons) they can also be enjoyed by adults with a
suitably sick mind.  All of his books I've read do have some sort of SF,
Fantasy or Non-Reality slant to them, so he really does belong in
SF-Lovers.  A good place to start would be the "Snarkout Boys" books.
In a more mundane realm, he is a regular commentator on NPR's All Things

Well, since people keep asking for book lists, I'm going to keep producing
them to order.

The is for H. Beam Piper, best known for his Fuzzy novels.  I prefer his
paratime (alternate history / timetravel) novels myself.  There's
something about the worlds he created that stick with you: several
authors have written "sequels" to his stories (which are listed below).

Tim Powers' first two books are best left forgotten (even the re-writes).
"The Drawing of the Dark" is an entertaining book, especially for its
central revelation (which I refuse to spoil).  His later books, however,
are excellent.  From the gonzo alternate history / time travel of "The
Anubis Gates", to the bizarre post-apocalyptic visions of "Dinner at
Deviant's Palace" to Voodoo and Blackbeard in "On Stranger Tides".  Any
of his later books are recommended, and I'm looking forward to "The
Stress of Her Regard".

Terry Pratchett is another guy with a strange sense of humor, but he
writes on a more adult level.  I really like his "Discworld" series,
which is a really, really funny lampoon of every fantasy idea you've ever
read.  The main disadvantage is that since he is British, his books are
published on the American side of the pond one year later.

To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 18-Oct-93

Mack Reynolds's prose has some real problems, but he is one of the few SF
authors to give real thought to the wide variety of possible social &
economic structures in the future.  While many mainstream authors were
writing about 1950's america in galactic spanning empires (huh?),
Reynolds was writing (serious and satire) about every social-economic
system I have heard of.  I prefer his short stories, so try "The Best of
Mack Reynolds".

Subject: Author Lists: Jennifer Roberson
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 10-Jul-93

Jennifer Roberson is in the process of writing two fantasy series: The
Chronicles of the Cheysuli and The Sword Series.  Of the two I prefer the
Cheysuli.  It has several standard elements: two magical races at war with
the other (aka the good guys and the bad guys), a prophecy, and a royal
line destined to rule the world.  But as the series progresses, the good
guys don't look as unambiguously good and the bad guys have excellent
reasons for opposing the prophecy.  The second leading cause of trouble
in the series are arranged royal marriages, and their consequences
[number one being the conflict between the two magical races].  And (my
favorite) each book covers the next generation (except the first two
books to set things up).  Since each new book has a new main cast (with
the surviving main cast of the previous book acting as elder statesmen)
it means that *ANYTHING* (death, maiming, changing sides) can happen to
the characters of the current book, both good and bad, as long as the
plot advances toward the final resolution.  And the end is approaching
fast!  Recommended.

Edited: 18-Oct-93

I've only read one Keith Roberts book, but it was wonderful.  "Pavane" is
the best alternate history novels I've read.  It postulates a medieval
society extended until the late 20th century (complete with lords and a
powerful church). Very nicely written as a group of interlocking stories,
it's really recommended.  I own a couple of other of his books, but I
haven't read them yet.

To me Spider Robinson is one of those frustrating writers.  He obviously
has the ability to be a great writer, but just hasn't put everything
together yet.  Never the less, he has written some fine material.  I like

Rudy Rucker is unusual in that his non-fiction (popular speculative
mathematics books) has a great deal in common with his fiction.  In the
books I've read ("Master of Time and Space" & "The Sex Sphere"), odd
bits of mathematics form central pieces to his work.  They are also more
than slightly strange.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

Joanna Russ is one of the most talented (as well as one of the most
extreme) feminist SF writers.  The one facet balances against the other
so that there is strongly differing critical opinions on her work.  The
works that I've read ("Alyx", "And Chaos Died" & "The Zanzibar Cat") were
both provocative & extremely well written, if a bit strident at times.
People interested in feminist writing in general should check out some of
her non-SF critical essays (many are found in the books: "How to Suppress
Women's Writings" [1983] & "Magic Mommas, Trembling Sisters, Puritans
and Perverts: Feminist Essays [1985]).

Edited: 5-Feb-94

Eric Frank Russell has written some wonderful stuff (as well as some that
just OK, but then one can't expect miracles).  "And Then There Were None"
is a classic tale of passive resistance.  A lot of Russell's work is
humorous.  Not the fall down silly funny of Fredric Brown or Randall
Garrett, nor the sharp biting satire of William Tenn, but a warm chuckle.
"The Best Of" is a good starting place for the Russell neophyte.  (In
fact, the entire "Best of" series published by Del Rey in the middle-late
70's is a great way of meeting the better authors of the 1940's and
1950's).

classic SF world building scenario, but Sargent has a much greater
emphasis on 3-dimensional, believable characters than is usual in the
field.  I am looking forward to the other two (?) books in this series.

Edited: 7-May-94

I've read a couple of Elizabeth Scarborough's light fantasies (I think
they were Song of Sorcery & The Unicorn Creed) and frankly I thought
they sucked.  Her two serious fantasies, however, I really enjoyed.
The Healer's War is the story of a Vietnam nurse.  The tone is much
darker, and the characterization is much richer than her previous
novels.  The novel is at least partially auto-biographical, since
Elizabeth Scarborough *was* a nurse in Vietnam.  Nothing Sacred
continues in this vein, being the story of American soldiers in the
21st century captured in Tibet and kept in a mysterious prisoner of war
camp.  A sequel is promised for Nothing Sacred.  Given how that novel
ends, it will be interesting to see the direction the next novel takes.

Now we come to a great sentimental favorite, James Schmitz.  While he's
not as technically impressive as many other writers, I find all of his
stories vastly enjoyable.  His characters in particular are wonderful.
I have all of his books, except "A Nice Day For Screaming", which is
impossible to find.  Newcomers should try "The Witches of Karres" or a
Telzy book.

I haven't read very much of Bob Shaw's books, but I do like what I've
read. My favorite is "Other Days, Other Eyes".  He introduces one
technological invention, and then develops the consequences realistically
and with attention to the people involved.  The invention in this case is
"Slow Glass", a substance that traps light for weeks or years, then
exactly transmits what it received.  I'll let others who are better read
recommend some of his other works.

Edited: 1-Mar-94

Robert Silverberg's work can be divided into three eras: Late 50's to
early 60's; Late 60's to Mid-70's; 80's.  The early Silverberg wrote
decent craftsman like stories (and a lot of junk).  So it came as a
surprise to a lot of people when he started writing the really great
stuff after taken a few years absence from SF.  This period of intense
writing produced some masterpieces.  Then he took off from SF for
several more years, and came back to SF with "Lord Valentine's Castle".
He's put out some very nice work the last few years.

Robert Silverberg has also edited dozens of anthologies.

Edited: 4-Mar-94

Clifford Simak is probably the best known proponent of "pastoral" SF
(Zenna Henderson is another).  Unlike most hard SF writers of the
40's/50's, much of Simak's work has mystical theme.  "City" and "Way
Station" are two of the most important of his many works.

John Sladek is another SF humourist, but his has a more sarcastic, biting

Cordwainer Smith wrote wonderful (if idiosyncratic) short stories.
Unfortunately there are far too few of them.  His stories have a romantic,
folk-tale quality that I can occasionally find in the very best juvenile
fantasy, but I've never seen matched in science fiction.  "The Ballad of
Lost C'Mell", "The Lady Who Sailed _The Soul_", "Scanners Live In Vain",
"The Game of Rat and Dragon", "A Planet Named Shayol", among others, are
all stories to conjure by.  Really, really, *really* recommended.  One of
my all time favorites.

Thorne Smith wrote whimsical fantasies.  Even if you haven't read any of
them, you've probably seen them in the movies or on TV.  There's "Topper",
two novels about ghosts & a meek banker that turned into three movies
and a TV series, "The Passionate Witch" about life with a beautiful witch
witch was filmed as "I Married a Witch" starring Veronica Lake (sigh),
"Turnabout" with a husband and wife who wake up in the other's bodies
(filmed in 1940).  I've never read any of his books, but I've enjoyed
the films.

Subject: Author Lists: Clarke Ashton Smith
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 18-Oct-93

Clarke Ashton Smith was a writer in the "Weird Tales" tradition.  He was
an important influence on Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Jack Vance,
Robert E. Howard, Harlan Ellison, H. P. Lovecraft, and Ray Bradbury.  He
spun unusual tales of exotic settings, all told in a rich (almost baroque)
style.  Although he produced over 100 short stories, almost all of it was
done in the six short years between 1930 and 1936.  Today his works are
hard to find, but the Ballantine books of the early 1970's and the Pocket
books of early 1980's aren't *too* hard to find in used book stores.  His
poetry is also of interest to the SF reader, it shares many of the themes
of his short stories.

"Doc" Smith defines space opera.  Heroes are larger than life.  Villains
are blacker than space, and Weapons are humongously powerful.  And the
writing, frankly, sucked.  In all fairness, the best of "Doc" Smith
fairly good.  And if you are willing to overlook the prose, you get the
straight "sense of wonder" stuff, 180 proof.  I  have always preferred
his Lensmen series, since it gives maximum scope for his plots.

I still think that Norman Spinrad's best work is "Bug Jack Barron".
Although it is dated in many ways, its still an excellent novel on the
applications and limits of power in the media.  I also liked "The Iron
Dream", a weird novel within a novel, written by Aldoph Hitler (in an
alternate timeline where Hitler emigrates to America, becomes a pulp SF
author and wins the Hugo).  Like all good satires, the satire is close
enough to pulp SF that it could be mistaken the original. Disturbing,
but recommended.

Here's a listing of (almost) all Star Trek books.  It's not as complete
as my usual list, if only because it's inherently more difficult to list
all the books *about* something than all the books *written by* someone.
This is a fairly complete list, though.  Please note that I purposefully
did not list comic books, fanzines, magazines, filk song books, game
books, poetry, extremely juvenile books (coloring books, activity books,
etc.) and most small amateur press publications.  Because of the long and
varied history of publication, I've divided the books by publishers:
Pocket books & related publishers (current official Star Trek publisher,
they are owned by the same company that owns Paramount Pictures);
Ballantine (much of the non-fiction of the 70's); Bantam (most of the
original Star Trek novels); and Other publishers.

As for the books themselves, they are of wildly varying quality.
Personally, I only read a Star Trek novel if (1) I know and like the
author or (2) It was *really* recommended by a Star Trek fan or (3) It
was recommended by a SF fan.  My favorite Star Trek writers are John M.
Ford & Diane Duane in the classic series & Peter David in the new series.

Edited: 7-May-94

To me, Christopher Stasheff is the archetypical example of beating a
series to death (winning out over even Piers Anthony, Jack Chalker &
Philip Jose Farmer).  The first "Warlock" book was fairly good, the
second was OK, and the rest degenerate from there (being an optimist, I
stopped at #7).  The first one is good though.

Edited: 10-Mar-94

Of the three Bruce Sterling books I've read ("Involution Ocean",
"Schismatrix" and "Islands in the Net") I most enjoyed "Schismatrix".
"Schismatrix" has a wonderfully rich setting, with humans of various
stripes ("Mechs" - mechanically augmented & "Shapers" - biologically
augmented) struggling for the future direction of humanity throughout the
solar system.  Bruce Sterling is also the major spokesman of the
"Cyberpunk" movement, the politics of which I won't begin to get into.
His short fiction is well regarded, having been nominated for 12 Hugo &
Nebula awards (but never winning).  I'm looking forward to a collection
to come out in paperback.

Edited: 20-Jun-93

Mary Stewart's most famous work is her arthurian series.  King Arthur is
one of the two academically respectable areas in SF (the other being
utopias/distopias) [No slight to Mary Stewart intended, it's just a
general comment].  I mean, even John Steinbeck has done a book on the
Knights of the Round Table.  I'm burned out on the subject myself.  She's
also done a number of other fantasies, none of which I've read.

And now for one of my all time favorite authors: Theodore Sturgeon.  His

that have always stayed with me.  It seldom get better than this.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

Somtow Sucharitkul (I've heard it pronounced SOME-towe suture-WRIT-cool)
also writes as S. P. Somtow.  He's actually had books published under both
names (typically as Sucharitkul first).  In addition to writing SF, he's
also a composer of some fame.  He has also just made a direct-to-video
splatterpunk movie "The Laughing Dead" (starring, probably directed &
possibly written by). I've been told this movie has great production
values, a bizzare plot, and stars many SF authors as special guest zombies
& major characters.  Probably soon available a convention near you.

As for his writing, I find his sense of humor a bit too odd.  I can really
recommend his "Inquestor Tetralogy".  This series has scope, introduces
new art forms, and lots of ideas (even if they get out of control at
times).

Reportedly he wrote an interesting mixture of mythology in a historical
setting.

A pretty good fantasy writer.  One of the few who addresses how magic and
stuff would interact with the medieval christian church (Katherine Kurtz
being the only other one that spring to mind).  I'd recommend either of
her stand alone books ("A Wind in Cairo" a arabic horse fantasy & "Ars
Magica" a fantasy based on a real pope later accused of sorcery) over her
series for a beginner.

I have read the first three books of Patrick Tilley's Amtrak series.
(They are the only ones in the series to be published in America, all the
others have only been published in Great Britain).  They are a pretty
good post-WW III story, but I did enjoy the first two more than the
third.

It was somewhat of a shock, when, in 1976, it was revealed that James
Tiptree, Jr. was (gasp) a woman.  Personally, I've enjoyed what little
work I've read ("The Girl Who Was Plugged In", "Houston, Houston, Do You
Read?" & "Love Is the Plan, the Plan is Death"), but I've never felt
compelled to seek out any more.  So how's the rest of her work?

Wilson Tucker is a long time SF fan, publisher of many well regarded
fanzines in the 30's and 40's, and author of many fine novels.  He also has
a life long habit of using the name of SF fans and pros for the characters
of his books.  This process has come to be known as "Tuckerization".  As
for the books themselves, I've read and enjoyed both "The Lincoln Hunters"
and "The Year of the Quiet Sun".  I can especially recommend "The Lincoln
Hunters", a time travel story where investigators from a repressive future
U.S. are sent back in time to record a lost speech by Abraham Lincoln.  It
effectively contrasts the two settings and the different characters.

After seeing a few different Jack Vance lists (most of which are 80-90%
complete), I thought I'd give my version (rare and obscure books
included).

Jack Vance has written some marvelous stuff in his unique style: my
favorites are the Demon Princes and Dying Earth series.  If he has one
flaw, it's that all of his main characters have the same voice, a witty,
sardonic, (optionally) world-weary person.

There is just something about the writing of van Vogt. It has a horrible
style and plots that do not logically follow: yet his books work.  Some SF
critic (I think it was either Knight or Delany) said that problem any SF
critic needs to solve was not showing what was wrong with van Vogt"s style
(any bright high school student could do that) but figuring out why it
worked.

Joan D Vinge's best work is "The Snow Queen".  The Hugo winner is a
wonderful mixture of mythology and hard SF.  I also like "Psion", which
reads like a good Andre Norton juvenile.  The sequel "Catspaw" is much
more mature.  Lately she's been writing lots of movie novelizations;
which, while they pay the bills, are hardly high art.

Edited: 4-Mar-94

Most of Kurt Vonnegut's "real" SF was published by the middle 60's.  And
those books are all quite good: "Player Piano", "The Sirens of Titan",
"Cat's Cradle", and "Slaughterhouse-Five" are all very good SF.  After
that, however, things get complicated.  In remarks widely discussed in
the SF community, he publicly stated he wanted out of the label of
"Science Fiction" writer.  The repercussions that had is beyond the scope
of this introduction.  Since then he's written books that at least skirt
the edges of SF (on both sides).

And on a bibliographic note, I should mention the book "Venus on the
Half-Shell". When it was first published, the author was listed as
"Kilgore Trout".  Kilgore Trout is a Kurt Vonnegut character; a hack SF
writer who appears in several of Vonnegut's books.  This confused some
people, who thought that it must have been written by Vonnegut. The novel
was actually written by Philip Jose Farmer.  So don't be fooled.

The one Ian Watson book that I've read is "Queenmagic, Kingmagic", an
entertaining story of characters living their lives on worlds whose rules
derive from various games (chess, monopoly, go, chutes and ladders, etc.).
Apparently this is an atypical work, since the descriptions of his other

Stanley Weinbaum had his first SF story published in the July 1934 issue
of _Wonder Stories_.  He died in December of 1935.  But in those few short
months, he helped transform SF from gimicky inventions with cardboard
characters to fiction with realistic people, alien aliens and decent
prose. His first story was "A Martian Odyssey" a good adventure staring
Tweel, probably the first major alien character who didn't act like a man
in a funny suit.  All of his stories are quite readable today (even if
some have dated).  "The Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum" is an excellent
place to get acquainted with this pioneering author.

The only Manly Wade Wellman I've read is his Silver John stories.  These
are rather good fantasies of a wandering balladeer in the deep
Appalachians.  The stories themselves are good, but what I find special
about them is their concrete sense of *place*.  From the speech to
beliefs to descriptions, you feel that it *really* is taking place in the
southern U.S.A.  Also recommended is "Sherlock Holmes's War of the
Worlds", a witty tale with Sherlock Holmes and Professor Challenger in
the setting of H. G. Wells' "War of the Worlds". It's a lot better if
you've read the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle & H. G. Wells,
of course.

Subject: Author Lists: H. G. Wells

To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 7-Oct-93

What can you say about H. G. Wells. He has one of the most legitimate
claims to the often bestowed title "Father of Science Fiction".  He
originated several standard SF concepts (the time machine & aliens
invading Earth, among others) and help synthesize many earlier elements
into one genre.  His early work is still quite readable and is
recommended.  His later work (after about 1905) suffers from the tendency
to do more sermonizing than story telling. He also wrote several popular
mainstream novels (which have faded into obscurity), a popular history of
the world, and many non-fiction works in his role as social critic.

I seem to remember (although I forget the source, so this may be untrue)
that he & Jules Verne vigorously denied that the other had any influence
on their work.  (The argument essentially being that Wells accused Verne
of being unable to write his way out of wet paper bag; while Verne
accused Wells of scientifically implausible ideas.  It's interesting to
see this conflict continue in SF up to the present day).

One can get a good core collection of Wells in just two thick volumes:
"Seven Science Fiction Novels" & "The Famous Short Stories of H.G. Wells",
nearly 1900 pages of good reading.

James White is one of the few writers of Medical SF (other major ones
include Alan Nourse & Murry Leinster's "Med" series).  His Sector General
stories are set in a multi-multi-species (& environment) hospital set
between galactic arms.  Often the problem is to figure out what is normal
for a new species before one can heal it.  His alien species do suffer a
bit from the "man in a rubber suit" too-human characterization, but the
species are interesting (and mostly plausible) and the stories are well
constructed and competently written.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

An author I can recommend.  I even own a copy of "The Tapestry Warriors"
in hardcover  I almost never buy hardcover (I buy too many books to afford
hardcovers), but it never came out in paperback.  She's done two series.
The Torin series is an alien contact novel with a marooned human trying
to get back to his expedition in a early-technological world with
marsupial sapients. The alien culture and interactions between the two
cultures are well done.  The Rulers of Hylor series is a quite good
fantasy.  Each book is about the trials of the heir of a different
kingdom.  All three novels intertwine (the three protagonists are
cousins), with the brilliant military victory in one novel is told as a
stunning defeat in the next.  The different points of view, and the very
different personalities and goals of the three heroes combine to make more
than the separate stories.  Cherry Wilder has also written several good
short stories, I hope someone publishes a collection soon.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

I've read only a few Kate Wilhelm novels, but they've all been quite
good. "Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang" is required reading, dealing with
cloning and the end of the world.  The other two tales of apocalypse
("Juniper Time" & "Welcome, Chaos") are also very good and recommended.
However, I found "Crazy Time" to be disappointing, with the
characterizations just a bit off (the ?major? was just too stereotyped to
be tolerated).  Her one series is an interesting mixture of SF & Mystery
genres (that I haven't read).

Actually, no one asked for a Jack Williamson list.  After ~150 authors,
omitting Jack Williamson just **had** to be an oversight.  He's had one of
the longest careers in SF (61 years and counting).  He is certainly one of
the most readable of the Golden Age writers still active.  In my opinion,
his very best work is "The Humanoids" (my edition also includes the great
the short story "With Folded Hands").  It deals with the invention of a
race of robots charged "To Serve And Obey, And Guard Men From Harm".  The
problem is that they judge everything from bicycles to unsupervised sex
as too harmful to be allowed.  Forget Steven King,  this is scary.  Also
quite good is "Three From the Legion" (one of the best written space
operas of the golden age), "Darker Than You Think" (one of the few novels
that deal with werewolves) and "SeeTee" (anti-matter or "contraterrane"
as it was known).  "The Best of Jack Williamson" is a good selection of
his stories.

I think all of Walter Jon Williams's work is worth reading, but I most
enjoy his "The Crown Jewels" / "House of Shards" books.  They are a witty
SF comedy of manners with the main character an "allowed" thief
(registered thieves are an accepted part of society, provided they steal
with style). An interesting successor to the Alesei Panshin "Anthony
Villiers" books.

Edited: 5-Feb-94

Paul O. Williams has done one really good series: the Pelbar Cycle.  This
is an extremely well done post-apocalypse setting.  Unlike most stories
in this vein, I actually *believed* there would be enough people to start
over. It takes place about 1000 years after the devastation (hint, it's
not your standard nuclear war even though there is a number of
uninhabitable radioactive areas).  By this point the population has
built up where isolated groups of people are beginning to expand beyond
their borders. The books have a rich variety of political, economic, and
religious systems, languages, art, technology. etc.  The story follows a
natural progression as the society and people change as a result of the
events of all the previous books.  Heroes are explorers, inventors,
diplomats, warriors as the needs of the environment change.  Recommended.

Robert Anton Wilson writes weird stuff.  Best known as the co-author of
the "Illuminatus" trilogy, he's written several other books on the same
themes of paranoia, conspiracy and search for alternate awareness.
Because his work is orthogonal to the fiction / non-fiction axis, I've
listed his non-fiction as well.  "Masks of the Illuminati" is probably
the best stand-alone book, but I'd personally recommend going for the
entire "Illuminatus" trilogy.  Don't worry if you find it confusing,
it's designed that way.

Edited: 11-Mar-94

Gene Wolfe.  His early work is mixed ("The Fifth Head of Cerberus" is
recommended, and I also liked "Peace", but that's an individual quirk).
Coming into the 1980's is where he really shines.  "The Book of the New
Sun".  Words fail me.  It's just amazing, for the use of language if
nothing else.  After that, it becomes even more subjective than usual.  I
rather like "Soldier of the Mist", but I'm withholding judgment until
the series is complete.  Of all his story collections (and I haven't read
his recent ones), "The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other
Stories" is the best.  The beginning Wolfe reader should probably start
on "The Island of Doctor Death..." or "The Fifth Head of Cerberus",
before going on to "The Shadow of the Torturer" or other works.
Personally, I must be in the correct frame of mind to read Wolfe.  This
is stuff that you have to pay attention to when you read, not skim over
for entertainment.  But the rewards make it worth all the effort.   Give
him a try.

Patricia Wrede writes entertaining, nicely written fantasies.  My personal

an interesting structure.  The entire novel is told as a series of
letters between two teenage girls set in Regency London where magic
works).  The others are worth checking out as well.

John Wyndham is a pseudonym for John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris
(he seems to have generated pseudonyms by taking two random names of the
six).  He's one of a handful of british authors who achieved SF fame in
the 1950's by destroying the earth in a variety of interesting ways (see
also J. G. Ballard, Brian Aldiss & John Christopher).  Two of his novels
have been filmed, "The Day of the Triffids" (as a fair movie and
excellent TV movie) and The Midwich Cuckoos" (a very effective movie).
His stories tend to be about fantastic things happening to very
believable people.  Recommended both for his interesting ideas, but most
especially for his characterizations.  Try either of his filmed novels,
"The Kraken Wakes", "The Chrysalids", or "Tales of Gooseflesh and
Laughter".

specials was "Time of the Fourth Horseman" by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro.

I've only read a few Chelsea Quinn Yarbro books, all of them in the Count
de Saint-Germain series.  They were entertaining vampire novels,
interesting as much for the historical setting as the plot and characters.
And there were a couple of novels I couldn't determine if they were SF
or not.

Subject: Author Lists: Jane Yolen
From: jwenn@world.std.com (John Wenn)
To: SF-LOVERS%rutgers:EDU
Edited: 4-Mar-94

Jane Yolen is a one woman publishing house.  As a matter of fact, she has
just started her own imprint "Jane Yolen Books" as part of Harcourt Brace
Jonanovich publishers.  Her particular strengths lie in the great
tradition of oral storytelling and folktales: marvelous flowing language,
spellbinding stories, and a sense of timelessness.  And several of her
books are wonderfully illustrated.  The stories range in age from children
(Commander Toad aboard the starship "Star Warts") to adolescent (the very
good Pit Dragon trilogy) to adult (the recommended Sister Light - Sister
Dark books).  Well worth reading.

[C] == Story Collection.
[YA] == The book is for young adults (however you define them).
[O] == Omnibus.  Includes other books.
