Subject: Book Intro:  "Presumed Guilty, How & Why the WC Framed L. H. Oswald"


    The unaccountability of government has gone to the point where the very
    use of the law is the instrument of illegality.

   This post is an introduction to the book,

                              Presumed Guilty
         How and Why the Warren Commission Framed Lee Harvey Oswald
   A factual account based on the Commission's public and private documents

   (c) 1976, by Howard Roffman.  It includes some excerpts from the Preface,
   Introduction, and Conclusion.  In the fifteen-plus years since I began
   reading about the assassination of President Kennedy, one of the most
   obvious (yet consistently denied) facts about the twisted "official
   mythology" is the issue of who killed JFK.  This matter was never
   resolved because the crime itself was never legitimately investigated.
   Period.  If Lee Oswald had lived to stand trial, the prosecution would
   *NOT* have been able to convict him of the murder in the way the  "The
   Warren Commission Show"--in the minds of enough people--was able to do.

   This is THE BOOK to read for the best detailed and comprehensive
   explanation of how Lee Oswald could not have killed President Kennedy as
   the official reality consortium--acting through the Warren Commission,
   the House Select Committee on Assassinations and state press/corporate
   media--claim he did.  Using as documentation the Commission's once-secret
   working papers, Howard Roffman meticulously demonstrates how at every
   turn, the Warren Commission's entire approach was based upon the
   *presumption* of Lee Oswald's guilt.  It didn't matter to the Commission
   that the preponderance of facts in the case didn't support this
   presumption.  Roffman sums up the devastating result of "working
   backwards" from such a pre-judged conclusion:

       . . . when the Commissioners decided in advance that the wrong man
      was the lone assassin, whatever their intentions, they protected
      the real assassins.  Through their staff they misinformed the
      American people and falsified history.


   Near the end of the preface, Roffman articulates some of the fundamental
   implications that must be confronted by every citizen in a situation
   where those in power consciously choose to betray the trust of the
   people they are sworn to serve:

         My political maturity began to develop only in the past few
      years;  all of my research on the assassination was conducted while
      I was a teenager.  Yet the basic knowledge that my government could
      get away with what it did at the murder of a president made me
      fearful of the future.  On October 10, 1971, when I was eighteen
      years old, I wrote what I hoped would be the last letter in a long
      and fruitless correspondence with a lawyer who had participated in
      the official cover-up as an investigator for the Warren Commission.
      I concluded that letter with these words:

            I ask myself if this country can survive when men like
         you, who are supposed to represent law and justice, are the
         foremost merchants of official falsification, deceit, and
         criminality.

         It was to take three years and the worst political crisis in our
      history for the press and the public to even begin to awaken to the
      great dangers a democracy faces when lawyers are criminals.


   Previous to this, Roffman quotes Harold Weisberg, one of the leading
   "first generation" assassination researchers, and expands on the meaning
   of his words:

            If the government can manufacture, suppress and lie when
         a President is cut down--and get away with it--what cannot
         follow?  Of what is it not capable, regardless of motive...?
            This government {did} manufacture, suppress and lie when
         it pretended to investigate the assassination of John F.
         Kennedy.
            If it can do that, it can do anything.
            And will, if we let it.

      Weisberg, in effect, warned that the executive would inevitably
      commit wrongdoing beyond imagination so long as there was no
      institution of government or society that was willing to stop it.
      That one man of modest means could make this simple deduction in
      1966 is less a credit to him than it is an indictment of a whole
      system of institutions that failed in their fundamental
      responsibility to society.



   There are people who continue to cling to the belief that the Warren
   Commission's and the House Select Committee on Assassinations'
   conclusions were and are essentially sound, and that Lee Oswald, firing
   3 shots from the sixth floor window, wounded Governor Connally and
   killed President Kennedy.  The powers that be will continue to attempt
   to prop up such lies only so long as we the people continue to allow
   them to do so by our own cultural propensity for denial.  One of the
   nation's founders (was it Jefferson?) said something to the effect that
   in order for a democracy to remain vital and not become co-opted by
   concentrated wealth and power, a revolution ought to be joined every 19
   years or so.  We are LONG overdue for our own.

   In the final analysis, anything which is held in secrecy, is held above
   accountability.  Working in secret the Commission staff was able to
   conduct their deliberations in a manner that was at odds with the facts
   in the case.  Such unaccountability, from the highest levels of
   authority on down, has become the sine qua non of our society and "way
   of life."  The trappings of a "constitutional democratic republic" still
   exist and are touted by corporate and elected leaders to serve their own
   ends, but the reality is that these symbols are largely hollow and have
   been uniformly pre-empted by inherently anti-democratic principles,
   policies and laws.  The crimes that have been committed under the rubric
   of "national security" at least equal anything the Nazis ever attempted.
   They are all the more hideous primarily because "we the people" are not
   "allowed" to know about their breadth and depth which is a fundamental
   prerequisite to addressing their consequences (like the more than
   74,000 toxic waste dumps listed by the EPA's Superfund some years ago,
   created secretly and beyond accountability by the military-industrial
   complex) and stopping and dealing with their perpetrators.

       . . . from the very beginning of its investigation, the
      Commission planned its work under the presumption that Oswald was
      guilty, and the staff consciously endeavored to construct a
      prosecution case against Oswald.  One Commission member actually
      complained to the staff that he wanted to see more arguments in
      support of the theory that Oswald was the assassin.  There could
      have been no more candid admission of how fraudulent the
      "investigation" was than when a staff lawyer secretly wrote, "Our
      intention is not to establish the point with complete accuracy, but
      merely to substantiate the hypothesis which underlies the
      conclusions that Oswald was the sole assassin."  In its zeal to
      posthumously frame Oswald--and falsify history--the staff often
      considered ludicrous methods of avoiding the facts--as in the
      suggestion of one staff lawyer that "the best evidence that Oswald
      could fire as fast as he did and hit the target is the fact that he
      did so." (pp. 249-250)

      Without a doubt, the falsehoods and misrepresentations disseminated
      by the government and the media concerning the assassination of
      President Kennedy are as odious in our society as the assassination
      itself.  The freedoms guaranteed under the law are without meaning
      unless the people are honestly and competently informed.  Indeed,
      when a government can get away with whitewashing the truth about a
      president's murder, the suggestion of authoritarianism is more than
      apparent.  (pp. 23-24)

       . . .  Throughout that hectic weekend, the Dallas Police made
      repeated public accusations of Oswald's guilt.  Oswald steadfastly
      maintained that he was innocent and said he would prove it when he
      was brought to trial.  (p. 25)

         Whoever killed President John F. Kennedy got away with it
      because the Warren Commission, the executive commission responsible
      for investigating the murder, engaged in a cover-up of the truth
      and issued a report that misrepresented or distorted almost every
      relevant fact about the crime.  The Warren Commission, in turn, got
      away with disseminating falsehood and covering up because virtually
      every institution in our society that is supposed to make sure that
      the government works properly and honestly failed to function in
      the face of a profound challenge;  the Congress, the law, and the
      press all failed to do a single meaningful thing to correct the
      massive abuse committed by the Warren Commission.  To anyone who
      understood these basic facts, and there were few who did, the
      frightening abuses of the Nixon Administration that have come to be
      known as "Watergate" were not unexpected and were surprising only
      in their nature and degree.
         This is not a presumptuous statement.  I do not mean to imply
      that anyone who knew what the Warren Commission did could predict
      the events that have taken place in the last few years.  My point
      is that the reaction to the Warren Report, if properly understood,
      demonstrated that our society had {nothing} that could be depended
      upon to protect it from the abuses of power that have long been
      inherent in the Presidency.  The dynamics of our system of
      government are such that every check on the abuse of power is
      vital;  if the executive branch were to be trusted as the sole
      guardian of the best interests of the people, we would not have a
      constitution that divides power among three branches of government
      to act as checks on each other, and we would need no Bill of
      Rights.  Power invites abuses and excesses, and at least since the
      presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, an enormous amount of power has
      been assumed and acquired by the president.
         Political deception is an abuse that democracy invites;  in a
      system where the leaders are ultimately accountable to the people,
      where their political future is decided by the people, there is
      inevitably the temptation to deceive, to speak with the primary
      interest of pleasing the people and preserving political power.
      There probably has not been a president who has not lied for
      political reasons.  I need only cite some more recent examples:
         Franklin Roosevelt assured the parents of America in October
      1940 that "your boys are not going to be sent into foreign wars";
      at the time he knew that American involvement in World War II was
      inevitable, even imminent, but he chose not to be frank with the
      people for fear of losing the 1940 election.
         Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 denied that the American aircraft shot
      down by the Russians over their territory was a spy-plane, when he
      {and} the Russians knew very well that the plane, a U-2, had been
      on a CIA reconnaissance flight;
         John F. Kennedy had the American ambassador at the United
      Nations deny that the unsuccessful invasion of Cuba at the Bay of
      Pigs was an American responsibility when exactly the opposite was
      true.
         So, deception and cover-up per se did not originate with the
      Warren Commission in 1964 or the Nixon administration in 1972.
      They had always been an unfortunate part of our political system.
      With the Warren Commission they entered a new and more dangerous
      phase.  Never before, to my knowledge, had there been such a
      systematic plan for a cover-up, or had such an extensive and
      pervasive amount of deception been attempted.  And certainly never
      before had our government collaborated to deny the public the true
      story of how its leader was assassinated.
         In the face of this new and monumental abuse of authority by the
      executive, all the institutions that are supposed to protect
      society from such abuses failed and, in effect, helped perpetrate
      the abuse itself.  As with Watergate, numerous lawyers were
      involved with the Warren Commission;  in neither case did these
      lawyers act as lawyers.  Rather, they participated in a cover-up
      and acted as accessories in serious crimes.  The Congress accepted
      the Warren Report as the final solution to the assassination and
      thus acquiesced in the cover-up of a President's murder.  And,
      perhaps most fundamentally, the press failed in its responsibility
      to the people and became, in effect, an unofficial mouthpiece of
      the government.  For a short time the press publicized some of the
      inconsistencies between the Warren Report's conclusions and the
      evidence;  yet never did the press seriously question the
      legitimacy of the official findings on the assassination or attempt
      to ascertain why the Johnson administration lied about the murder
      that brought it into power and what was hidden by those lies.

         In its approach, operations and Report, the Commission
         considered one possibility alone--that Lee Harvey Oswald,
         without assistance, assassinated the President and killed
         Officer Tippit.  Never has such a tremendous array of power
         been turned against a single man, and he was dead.  Yet even
         without opposition the Commission failed. . . .
         A crime such as the assassination of the President of the
         United States cannot be left as the Report . . . has left
         it, without even the probability of a solution, with
         assassins and murderers free, and free to repeat their
         crimes and enjoy what benefits they may have expected to
         enjoy therefrom.  No President is ever safe if Presidential
         assassins are exculpated.  Yet that is what the Commission
         has done.  In finding Oswald "guilty," it has found those
         who assassinated him "innocent."  If the President is not
         safe, then neither is the country.[29]
         Much more does it relate to each individual American, to the
         integrity of the institutions of our society, when anything
         happens to any president--especially when he is
         assassinated.
         The consignment of President John F. Kennedy to history with
         the dubious epitaph of the whitewashed investigation is a
         grievous event.[30]
         Above all, the Report leaves in jeopardy the rights of all
         Americans and the honor of the nation.  When what happened
         to Oswald once he was in the hands of the public authority
         can occur in this country with neither reprimand nor
         question, no one is safe.  When the Federal government puts
         its stamp of approval on such unabashed and open denial of
         the most basic legal rights of any American, no matter how
         insignificant he may be, then no American can depend on
         having those rights, no matter what his power or
         connections. The rights of all Americans, as the
         Commission's chairman said when wearing his Chief Justice's
         hat, depend upon each American's enjoyment of these same
         rights.[31]

      Perhaps the simplest statement of the context enunciated by
      Weisberg is contained in the quotation that I included in the
      Preface of this book:  "If the government can manufacture, suppress
      and lie when a President is cut down--and get away with it--what
      cannot follow?"[32] (pp. 32-33)

         I support the movement toward a new investigation, but the vital
      question now concerns {what} should be investigated.  A
      congressional reopening of the case should focus on those areas
      which will yield meaningful findings and serve a constructive
      national purpose.  Such an investigation would inevitably have to
      deal with the question of "Who killed Kennedy?"  However, my own
      familiarity with the evidence leads me to believe that an inquiry
      limited only to that question would be doomed to achieving very
      little.  The major question at this point is "Who covered up the
      truth about the murder, how, and why?"  A congressional
      investigation could establish with little effort that the Warren
      Report's "solution" of the crime is erroneous;  the Commission's
      files, as well as the files of other federal agencies, would
      provide a fertile starting point for the determination of
      responsibility in the cover-up.  The participants in all stages of
      the official investigation of the assassination are either known or
      identifiable, and those individuals still living can be subjected
      to cross-examination.  I do not personally believe that the federal
      investigators knew who killed President Kennedy.  But the evidence
      is certain that decisions were made, at times and levels now
      unknown, that the truth about the assassination should not be
      discovered, that falsehood should be disseminated to the people.
      When such decisions are made by the government, the Congress has a
      reason, indeed an obligation, to investigate and to assure that the
      executive is made to account. (pp. 30-31)

         Once it is established that Oswald's rifle was not involved in
      the shooting, there is not a shred of tangible or credible evidence
      to indicate that Oswald was the assassin.  The evidence proves
      exactly the opposite.
         The circumstantial evidence relating to Oswald himself is almost
      entirely exculpatory.  Every element of it was twisted by the
      Commission to fit the preconceived conclusion of Oswald's guilt.  I
      have documented that, through its staff and its Report, the
      Commission:

          1.  Drew undue suspicion to Oswald's return to Irving on
              November 21, although the evidence indicated that
              Oswald did not know the motorcade route and broke no
              set pattern in making the return;

          2.  Ignored {all} evidence that could have provided an
              innocent excuse for Oswald's visit;

          3.  Wrongly discredited the reliable and consistent
              testimony of the only two witnesses who saw the package
              Oswald carried to work on the morning of the
              assassination;  because their descriptions meant that
              the package could {not} have contained the rifle, the
              Commission claimed to have made this rejection on the
              basis of "scientific evidence," which did not exist;

          4.  Concluded that Oswald made a paper sack to conceal the
              rifle, citing no evidence in support of this notion and
              suppressing evidence that tended to disprove it;

          5.  Concluded that the sack was used to transport the
              rifle, although its evidence proved that the sack never
              contained the rifle;

          6.  Used the testimony of Charles Givens to placed [sic]
              Oswald at the alleged source of the shots {35 minutes
              too early,} even though Givens described an event that
              physically could not have taken place;

          7.  Claimed to know of no Depository employee who saw
              Oswald between 11:55 and 12:30, basing its claim on an
              inquiry in which it (through General Counsel Rankin)
              had the FBI determine whether any employee had seen
              Oswald {only} at 12:30, completely suppressing from the
              Report three distinct pieces of evidence indicating
              Oswald's presence on the first floor during the period
              in question.

          8.  Failed to produce any witness who could identify the
              sixth-floor gunman as Oswald;  both rejected and
              accepted the identification of one man who admitted
              lying to the police, who constantly contradicted
              himself, and who described physically impossible
              events;  and ignored evidence of clothing descriptions
              that might have indicated that Oswald was {not} the
              gunman;

          9.  Reconstructed the movements of Baker and Truly in such
              a way as to lengthen the time of their ascent to the
              second floor;

         10.  Reconstructed the movements of the "assassin" so as to
              greatly reduce the time of his presumed descent;  a
              valid reconstruction would have proved that a sixth-
              floor gunman could {not} have reached the second-floor
              lunch-room before Baker and Truly;

         11.  Misrepresented Baker's position at the time he saw
              Oswald entering the lunchroom, making it seem possible
              that Oswald could have just descended from the third
              floor, although, in fact, the events described by Baker
              and Truly prove that Oswald must have been coming {up}
              from the {first} floor (as Oswald himself told the
              police he did);

         12.  Misrepresented the nature of the assassination shots by
              omitting from its evaluation the time factor and other
              physical obstacles, thus making it seem that the shots
              were easy and that Oswald could have fired them;

         13.  Misrepresented the evidence relevant to Oswald's rifle
              capability and practice, creating the impression that
              he was a good shot with much practice, although the
              evidence indicated exactly the opposite.  The
              conclusion dictated by all this evidence en masse is
              inescapable and overwhelming:  Lee Harvey Oswald never
              fired a shot at President Kennedy;  he was not even at
              the Depository window during the assassination;  and no
              one fired his rifle, the Mannlicher-Carcano, on that
              day.  Beyond any doubt, he is innocent of the monstrous
              crime with which he was charged and of which he was
              presumed guilty.  The official presumption of his guilt
              effectively cut off any quest for truth and led to the
              abandonment of the principles of law and honest
              investigation.  At {all} costs, the government has
              denied (and, to judge from its record, will continue to
              deny) Oswald's innocence and perpetuated the myth of
              his lone guilt.

         With this, a thousand other spiders emerge from the walls.
         It can now be inferred that Oswald was framed;  he was
      deliberately set up as the Kennedy assassin.  His rifle was found
      in the Depository.  We know that it had to have been put there;  we
      also know that it was not Oswald who put it there.  {Someone else
      did.}
         We know that a whole bullet traceable to Oswald's rifle turned
      up at Parkland Hospital;  we also know that this bullet was never
      in the body of either victim.  {Someone had to have planted it at
      the hospital.}  The same applies to the two identifiable fragments
      found in the front seat of the President's limousine.
         We know that someone shot and killed President Kennedy;  we also
      know that Oswald did not do this.  The real presidential murderers
      have escaped punishment through our established judicial channels,
      their crime tacitly sanctioned by those who endeavored to prove
      Oswald guilty.  The after-the-fact framing of Oswald by the federal
      authorities means, in effect, that the federal government has
      conspired to protect those who conspired to kill President Kennedy.
         It is not my responsibility to explain why the Commission did
      what it did, and I would deceive the reader if I made the slightest
      pretense that it was within my capability to provide such an
      explanation.  I have presented the facts;  no explanation of
      motives, be they the highest and the purest or the lowest and the
      most corrupt, will alter those facts or undo what the Commission
      indisputably has done.
         The government has lied about one of the most serious crimes
      that can be committed in a democracy.  Having lied without
      restraint about the death of a president, it can not be believed on
      anything.  It has sacrificed its credibility.
         Remedies are not clearly apparent or easily suggested.
      Certainly, Congress has an obligation to investigate this
      monumental abuse by the executive.  But first and foremost, the
      people must recognize that they have been lied to by their
      government and denied the truth about the murder of their former
      leader.  They must demand the truth, whatever the price, and insist
      that their government work honestly and properly.
         Until then, the history of one of the world's most democratic
      nations must suffer the stigma of a frighteningly immoral and
      undemocratic act by its government. (pp. 251-255)

    The unaccountability of government has gone to the point where the very

   This post is an introduction to the book,

                              Presumed Guilty
         How and Why the Warren Commission Framed Lee Harvey Oswald
   A factual account based on the Commission's public and private documents

   (c) 1976, by Howard Roffman.  It includes some excerpts from the Preface,
   Introduction, and Conclusion.  In the fifteen-plus years since I began
   reading about the assassination of President Kennedy, one of the most
   obvious (yet consistently denied) facts about the twisted "official
   mythology" is the issue of who killed JFK.  This matter was never
   resolved because the crime itself was never legitimately investigated.
   Period.  If Lee Oswald had lived to stand trial, the prosecution would
   *NOT* have been able to convict him of the murder in the way the  "The
   Warren Commission Show"--in the minds of enough people--was able to do.

   This is THE BOOK to read for the best detailed and comprehensive
   explanation of how Lee Oswald could not have killed President Kennedy as
   the official reality consortium--acting through the Warren Commission,
   the House Select Committee on Assassinations and state press/corporate
   media--claim he did.  Using as documentation the Commission's once-secret
   working papers, Howard Roffman meticulously demonstrates how at every
   turn, the Warren Commission's entire approach was based upon the
   *presumption* of Lee Oswald's guilt.  It didn't matter to the Commission
   that the preponderance of facts in the case didn't support this
   presumption.  Roffman sums up the devastating result of "working
   backwards" from such a pre-judged conclusion:

       . . . when the Commissioners decided in advance that the wrong man
      was the lone assassin, whatever their intentions, they protected
      the real assassins.  Through their staff they misinformed the
      American people and falsified history.


   Near the end of the preface, Roffman articulates some of the fundamental
   implications that must be confronted by every citizen in a situation
   where those in power consciously choose to betray the trust of the
   people they are sworn to serve:

         My political maturity began to develop only in the past few
      years;  all of my research on the assassination was conducted while
      I was a teenager.  Yet the basic knowledge that my government could
      get away with what it did at the murder of a president made me
      fearful of the future.  On October 10, 1971, when I was eighteen
      years old, I wrote what I hoped would be the last letter in a long
      and fruitless correspondence with a lawyer who had participated in
      the official cover-up as an investigator for the Warren Commission.
      I concluded that letter with these words:

            I ask myself if this country can survive when men like
         you, who are supposed to represent law and justice, are the
         foremost merchants of official falsification, deceit, and
         criminality.

         It was to take three years and the worst political crisis in our
      history for the press and the public to even begin to awaken to the
      great dangers a democracy faces when lawyers are criminals.


   Previous to this, Roffman quotes Harold Weisberg, one of the leading
   "first generation" assassination researchers, and expands on the meaning
   of his words:

            If the government can manufacture, suppress and lie when
         a President is cut down--and get away with it--what cannot
         follow?  Of what is it not capable, regardless of motive...?
            This government {did} manufacture, suppress and lie when
         it pretended to investigate the assassination of John F.
         Kennedy.
            If it can do that, it can do anything.
            And will, if we let it.

      Weisberg, in effect, warned that the executive would inevitably
      commit wrongdoing beyond imagination so long as there was no
      institution of government or society that was willing to stop it.
      That one man of modest means could make this simple deduction in
      1966 is less a credit to him than it is an indictment of a whole
      system of institutions that failed in their fundamental
      responsibility to society.



   There are people who continue to cling to the belief that the Warren
   Commission's and the House Select Committee on Assassinations'
   conclusions were and are essentially sound, and that Lee Oswald, firing
   3 shots from the sixth floor window, wounded Governor Connally and
   killed President Kennedy.  The powers that be will continue to attempt
   to prop up such lies only so long as we the people continue to allow
   them to do so by our own cultural propensity for denial.  One of the
   nation's founders (was it Jefferson?) said something to the effect that
   in order for a democracy to remain vital and not become co-opted by
   concentrated wealth and power, a revolution ought to be joined every 19
   years or so.  We are LONG overdue for our own.

   In the final analysis, anything which is held in secrecy, is held above
   accountability.  Working in secret the Commission staff was able to
   conduct their deliberations in a manner that was at odds with the facts
   in the case.  Such unaccountability, from the highest levels of
   authority on down, has become the sine qua non of our society and "way
   of life."  The trappings of a "constitutional democratic republic" still
   exist and are touted by corporate and elected leaders to serve their own
   ends, but the reality is that these symbols are largely hollow and have
   been uniformly pre-empted by inherently anti-democratic principles,
   policies and laws.  The crimes that have been committed under the rubric
   of "national security" at least equal anything the Nazis ever attempted.
   They are all the more hideous primarily because "we the people" are not
   "allowed" to know about their breadth and depth which is a fundamental
   prerequisite to addressing their consequences (like the more than
   74,000 toxic waste dumps listed by the EPA's Superfund some years ago,
   created secretly and beyond accountability by the military-industrial
   complex) and stopping and dealing with their perpetrators.

       . . . from the very beginning of its investigation, the
      Commission planned its work under the presumption that Oswald was
      guilty, and the staff consciously endeavored to construct a
      prosecution case against Oswald.  One Commission member actually
      complained to the staff that he wanted to see more arguments in
      support of the theory that Oswald was the assassin.  There could
      have been no more candid admission of how fraudulent the
      "investigation" was than when a staff lawyer secretly wrote, "Our
      intention is not to establish the point with complete accuracy, but
      merely to substantiate the hypothesis which underlies the
      conclusions that Oswald was the sole assassin."  In its zeal to
      posthumously frame Oswald--and falsify history--the staff often
      considered ludicrous methods of avoiding the facts--as in the
      suggestion of one staff lawyer that "the best evidence that Oswald
      could fire as fast as he did and hit the target is the fact that he
      did so." (pp. 249-250)

      Without a doubt, the falsehoods and misrepresentations disseminated
      by the government and the media concerning the assassination of
      President Kennedy are as odious in our society as the assassination
      itself.  The freedoms guaranteed under the law are without meaning
      unless the people are honestly and competently informed.  Indeed,
      when a government can get away with whitewashing the truth about a
      president's murder, the suggestion of authoritarianism is more than
      apparent.  (pp. 23-24)

       . . .  Throughout that hectic weekend, the Dallas Police made
      repeated public accusations of Oswald's guilt.  Oswald steadfastly
      maintained that he was innocent and said he would prove it when he
      was brought to trial.  (p. 25)

         Whoever killed President John F. Kennedy got away with it
      because the Warren Commission, the executive commission responsible
      for investigating the murder, engaged in a cover-up of the truth
      and issued a report that misrepresented or distorted almost every
      relevant fact about the crime.  The Warren Commission, in turn, got
      away with disseminating falsehood and covering up because virtually
      every institution in our society that is supposed to make sure that
      the government works properly and honestly failed to function in
      the face of a profound challenge;  the Congress, the law, and the
      press all failed to do a single meaningful thing to correct the
      massive abuse committed by the Warren Commission.  To anyone who
      understood these basic facts, and there were few who did, the
      frightening abuses of the Nixon Administration that have come to be
      known as "Watergate" were not unexpected and were surprising only
      in their nature and degree.
         This is not a presumptuous statement.  I do not mean to imply
      that anyone who knew what the Warren Commission did could predict
      the events that have taken place in the last few years.  My point
      is that the reaction to the Warren Report, if properly understood,
      demonstrated that our society had {nothing} that could be depended
      upon to protect it from the abuses of power that have long been
      inherent in the Presidency.  The dynamics of our system of
      government are such that every check on the abuse of power is
      vital;  if the executive branch were to be trusted as the sole
      guardian of the best interests of the people, we would not have a
      constitution that divides power among three branches of government
      to act as checks on each other, and we would need no Bill of
      Rights.  Power invites abuses and excesses, and at least since the
      presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, an enormous amount of power has
      been assumed and acquired by the president.
         Political deception is an abuse that democracy invites;  in a
      system where the leaders are ultimately accountable to the people,
      where their political future is decided by the people, there is
      inevitably the temptation to deceive, to speak with the primary
      interest of pleasing the people and preserving political power.
      There probably has not been a president who has not lied for
      political reasons.  I need only cite some more recent examples:
         Franklin Roosevelt assured the parents of America in October
      1940 that "your boys are not going to be sent into foreign wars";
      at the time he knew that American involvement in World War II was
      inevitable, even imminent, but he chose not to be frank with the
      people for fear of losing the 1940 election.
         Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 denied that the American aircraft shot
      down by the Russians over their territory was a spy-plane, when he
      {and} the Russians knew very well that the plane, a U-2, had been
      on a CIA reconnaissance flight;
         John F. Kennedy had the American ambassador at the United
      Nations deny that the unsuccessful invasion of Cuba at the Bay of
      Pigs was an American responsibility when exactly the opposite was
      true.
         So, deception and cover-up per se did not originate with the
      Warren Commission in 1964 or the Nixon administration in 1972.
      They had always been an unfortunate part of our political system.
      With the Warren Commission they entered a new and more dangerous
      phase.  Never before, to my knowledge, had there been such a
      systematic plan for a cover-up, or had such an extensive and
      pervasive amount of deception been attempted.  And certainly never
      before had our government collaborated to deny the public the true
      story of how its leader was assassinated.
         In the face of this new and monumental abuse of authority by the
      executive, all the institutions that are supposed to protect
      society from such abuses failed and, in effect, helped perpetrate
      the abuse itself.  As with Watergate, numerous lawyers were
      involved with the Warren Commission;  in neither case did these
      lawyers act as lawyers.  Rather, they participated in a cover-up
      and acted as accessories in serious crimes.  The Congress accepted
      the Warren Report as the final solution to the assassination and
      thus acquiesced in the cover-up of a President's murder.  And,
      perhaps most fundamentally, the press failed in its responsibility
      to the people and became, in effect, an unofficial mouthpiece of
      the government.  For a short time the press publicized some of the
      inconsistencies between the Warren Report's conclusions and the
      evidence;  yet never did the press seriously question the
      legitimacy of the official findings on the assassination or attempt
      to ascertain why the Johnson administration lied about the murder
      that brought it into power and what was hidden by those lies.

         In its approach, operations and Report, the Commission
         considered one possibility alone--that Lee Harvey Oswald,
         without assistance, assassinated the President and killed
         Officer Tippit.  Never has such a tremendous array of power
         been turned against a single man, and he was dead.  Yet even
         without opposition the Commission failed. . . .
         A crime such as the assassination of the President of the
         United States cannot be left as the Report . . . has left
         it, without even the probability of a solution, with
         assassins and murderers free, and free to repeat their
         crimes and enjoy what benefits they may have expected to
         enjoy therefrom.  No President is ever safe if Presidential
         assassins are exculpated.  Yet that is what the Commission
         has done.  In finding Oswald "guilty," it has found those
         who assassinated him "innocent."  If the President is not
         safe, then neither is the country.[29]
         Much more does it relate to each individual American, to the
         integrity of the institutions of our society, when anything
         happens to any president--especially when he is
         assassinated.
         The consignment of President John F. Kennedy to history with
         the dubious epitaph of the whitewashed investigation is a
         grievous event.[30]
         Above all, the Report leaves in jeopardy the rights of all
         Americans and the honor of the nation.  When what happened
         to Oswald once he was in the hands of the public authority
         can occur in this country with neither reprimand nor
         question, no one is safe.  When the Federal government puts
         its stamp of approval on such unabashed and open denial of
         the most basic legal rights of any American, no matter how
         insignificant he may be, then no American can depend on
         having those rights, no matter what his power or
         connections. The rights of all Americans, as the
         Commission's chairman said when wearing his Chief Justice's
         hat, depend upon each American's enjoyment of these same
         rights.[31]

      Perhaps the simplest statement of the context enunciated by
      Weisberg is contained in the quotation that I included in the
      Preface of this book:  "If the government can manufacture, suppress
      and lie when a President is cut down--and get away with it--what
      cannot follow?"[32] (pp. 32-33)

         I support the movement toward a new investigation, but the vital
      question now concerns {what} should be investigated.  A
      congressional reopening of the case should focus on those areas
      which will yield meaningful findings and serve a constructive
      national purpose.  Such an investigation would inevitably have to
      deal with the question of "Who killed Kennedy?"  However, my own
      familiarity with the evidence leads me to believe that an inquiry
      limited only to that question would be doomed to achieving very
      little.  The major question at this point is "Who covered up the
      truth about the murder, how, and why?"  A congressional
      investigation could establish with little effort that the Warren
      Report's "solution" of the crime is erroneous;  the Commission's
      files, as well as the files of other federal agencies, would
      provide a fertile starting point for the determination of
      responsibility in the cover-up.  The participants in all stages of
      the official investigation of the assassination are either known or
      identifiable, and those individuals still living can be subjected
      to cross-examination.  I do not personally believe that the federal
      investigators knew who killed President Kennedy.  But the evidence
      is certain that decisions were made, at times and levels now
      unknown, that the truth about the assassination should not be
      discovered, that falsehood should be disseminated to the people.
      When such decisions are made by the government, the Congress has a
      reason, indeed an obligation, to investigate and to assure that the
      executive is made to account. (pp. 30-31)

         Once it is established that Oswald's rifle was not involved in
      the shooting, there is not a shred of tangible or credible evidence
      to indicate that Oswald was the assassin.  The evidence proves
      exactly the opposite.
         The circumstantial evidence relating to Oswald himself is almost
      entirely exculpatory.  Every element of it was twisted by the
      Commission to fit the preconceived conclusion of Oswald's guilt.  I
      have documented that, through its staff and its Report, the
      Commission:

          1.  Drew undue suspicion to Oswald's return to Irving on
              November 21, although the evidence indicated that
              Oswald did not know the motorcade route and broke no
              set pattern in making the return;

          2.  Ignored {all} evidence that could have provided an
              innocent excuse for Oswald's visit;

          3.  Wrongly discredited the reliable and consistent
              testimony of the only two witnesses who saw the package
              Oswald carried to work on the morning of the
              assassination;  because their descriptions meant that
              the package could {not} have contained the rifle, the
              Commission claimed to have made this rejection on the
              basis of "scientific evidence," which did not exist;

          4.  Concluded that Oswald made a paper sack to conceal the
              rifle, citing no evidence in support of this notion and
              suppressing evidence that tended to disprove it;

          5.  Concluded that the sack was used to transport the
              rifle, although its evidence proved that the sack never
              contained the rifle;

          6.  Used the testimony of Charles Givens to placed [sic]
              Oswald at the alleged source of the shots {35 minutes
              too early,} even though Givens described an event that
              physically could not have taken place;

          7.  Claimed to know of no Depository employee who saw
              Oswald between 11:55 and 12:30, basing its claim on an
              inquiry in which it (through General Counsel Rankin)
              had the FBI determine whether any employee had seen
              Oswald {only} at 12:30, completely suppressing from the
              Report three distinct pieces of evidence indicating
              Oswald's presence on the first floor during the period
              in question.

          8.  Failed to produce any witness who could identify the
              sixth-floor gunman as Oswald;  both rejected and
              accepted the identification of one man who admitted
              lying to the police, who constantly contradicted
              himself, and who described physically impossible
              events;  and ignored evidence of clothing descriptions
              that might have indicated that Oswald was {not} the
              gunman;

          9.  Reconstructed the movements of Baker and Truly in such
              a way as to lengthen the time of their ascent to the
              second floor;

         10.  Reconstructed the movements of the "assassin" so as to
              greatly reduce the time of his presumed descent;  a
              valid reconstruction would have proved that a sixth-
              floor gunman could {not} have reached the second-floor
              lunch-room before Baker and Truly;

         11.  Misrepresented Baker's position at the time he saw
              Oswald entering the lunchroom, making it seem possible
              that Oswald could have just descended from the third
              floor, although, in fact, the events described by Baker
              and Truly prove that Oswald must have been coming {up}
              from the {first} floor (as Oswald himself told the
              police he did);

         12.  Misrepresented the nature of the assassination shots by
              omitting from its evaluation the time factor and other
              physical obstacles, thus making it seem that the shots
              were easy and that Oswald could have fired them;

         13.  Misrepresented the evidence relevant to Oswald's rifle
              capability and practice, creating the impression that
              he was a good shot with much practice, although the
              evidence indicated exactly the opposite.  The
              conclusion dictated by all this evidence en masse is
              inescapable and overwhelming:  Lee Harvey Oswald never
              fired a shot at President Kennedy;  he was not even at
              the Depository window during the assassination;  and no
              one fired his rifle, the Mannlicher-Carcano, on that
              day.  Beyond any doubt, he is innocent of the monstrous
              crime with which he was charged and of which he was
              presumed guilty.  The official presumption of his guilt
              effectively cut off any quest for truth and led to the
              abandonment of the principles of law and honest
              investigation.  At {all} costs, the government has
              denied (and, to judge from its record, will continue to
              deny) Oswald's innocence and perpetuated the myth of
              his lone guilt.

         With this, a thousand other spiders emerge from the walls.
         It can now be inferred that Oswald was framed;  he was
      deliberately set up as the Kennedy assassin.  His rifle was found
      in the Depository.  We know that it had to have been put there;  we
      also know that it was not Oswald who put it there.  {Someone else
      did.}
         We know that a whole bullet traceable to Oswald's rifle turned
      up at Parkland Hospital;  we also know that this bullet was never
      in the body of either victim.  {Someone had to have planted it at
      the hospital.}  The same applies to the two identifiable fragments
      found in the front seat of the President's limousine.
         We know that someone shot and killed President Kennedy;  we also
      know that Oswald did not do this.  The real presidential murderers
      have escaped punishment through our established judicial channels,
      their crime tacitly sanctioned by those who endeavored to prove
      Oswald guilty.  The after-the-fact framing of Oswald by the federal
      authorities means, in effect, that the federal government has
      conspired to protect those who conspired to kill President Kennedy.
         It is not my responsibility to explain why the Commission did
      what it did, and I would deceive the reader if I made the slightest
      pretense that it was within my capability to provide such an
      explanation.  I have presented the facts;  no explanation of
      motives, be they the highest and the purest or the lowest and the
      most corrupt, will alter those facts or undo what the Commission
      indisputably has done.
         The government has lied about one of the most serious crimes
      that can be committed in a democracy.  Having lied without
      restraint about the death of a president, it can not be believed on
      anything.  It has sacrificed its credibility.
         Remedies are not clearly apparent or easily suggested.
      Certainly, Congress has an obligation to investigate this
      monumental abuse by the executive.  But first and foremost, the
      people must recognize that they have been lied to by their
      government and denied the truth about the murder of their former
      leader.  They must demand the truth, whatever the price, and insist
      that their government work honestly and properly.
         Until then, the history of one of the world's most democratic
      nations must suffer the stigma of a frighteningly immoral and
      undemocratic act by its government. (pp. 251-255)

      1


      Assassination:  The Official Case




         As stated in its Report, one of the Warren Commission's main
      objectives was "to identify the person or persons responsible for
      both the assassination of President Kennedy and the killing of
      Oswald through an examination of the evidence" (Rxiv).
      Accordingly, the Commission produced one person whom it claimed to
      be solely responsible for the assassination:  Lee Harvey Oswald
      (R18-23).  Because the scope of the present study is limited to
      Oswald's role in the shooting, it is vital that we first understand
      the foundations for the Commission's conclusion that Oswald was
      guilty.
         In this chapter I will deal solely with the evidence that is
      alleged to prove Oswald's guilt, as presented in the Report.  I
      will make no attempt to criticize the selection of evidence, but
      rather will take the final report at face value, probing its logic
      and structure so that it can be judged whether the determination of
      Oswald's guilt is warranted by the "facts" set forth.
         The first and most vital step in determining who shot at the
      President involved ascertaining the location(s) and weapon(s) from
      which the shots came.  In a chapter entitled "The Shots From the
      Texas School Book Depository," the Commission "analyzes the
      evidence and sets forth its conclusions concerning the source,
      effect, number and timing of the shots that killed President
      Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally" (R61).


      {The Scene}

         The scene of the assassination was Dealey Plaza, the so-called
      heart of Dallas, made up of three streets that converge at a
      railroad overpass.  At the opposite side of the plaza are several
      buildings, many city owned.  Along each side leading to the
      underpass are grassy banks adorned with shrubbery and masonry
      structures.  Two grassy plots separate the three streets--Elm,
      Main, and Commerce--all of which intersect with Houston at the head
      of the plaza.  The shooting occurred as the Presidential limousine
      cruised down Elm Street toward the underpass.
         One of the major conclusions of the Commission is that the shots
      "were fired from the sixth floor window at the southeast corner of
      the Texas School Book Depository" (R18), a book warehouse located
      on the northwest corner of Elm and Houston.  (Oswald was employed
      in this building.)  Several factors influenced this conclusion.
         The Report first calls upon the witnesses who indicated in some
      way that the shots originated from this source.  It refers to two
      spectators who claimed to see "a rifle being fired" from the
      Depository window, two others who "saw a rifle in this window
      immediately after the assassination," and "three employees of the
      Depository, observing the parade from the fifth floor," who "heard
      the shots fired from the floor immediately above them" (R61).


      {The Limousine}

         Discussed next is the presidential automobile (R76-77).  On the
      night of the assassination, Secret Service agents found two
      relatively large bullet fragments in the front seat of the car--one
      consisting of the nose portion of a bullet, the other a section of
      the base portion.  An examination of the limousine on November 23
      by FBI agents disclosed three very small lead particles on the rug
      beneath the left jump seat, which had been occupied by Mrs.
      Connally, and a small lead residue on the inside surface of the
      windshield, with a corresponding series of cracks on the outer
      surface.  All of the metallic pieces were compared by
      spectrographic analysis by the FBI and "found to be similar in
      metallic composition, but it was not possible to determine whether
      two or more of the fragments came from the same bullet."  The
      physical characteristics of the windshield damage indicated that it
      was struck on the inside surface from behind, by a bullet fragment
      traveling at "fairly high velocity."


      {Ballistics}

         In a crime involving firearms, the ballistics evidence is always
      of vital importance.  This was especially true of the ballistics
      evidence adduced by the Commission relating to the President's
      murder.  As used in the Report, this evidence seems to have a
      clarifying effect, bringing together loose ends and creating a
      circumstantial but superficially persuasive case.  The relevant
      discussion is summarized in the Report as follows, based on
      unanimous expert testimony:

            The nearly whole bullet found on Governor Connally's
         stretcher at Parkland Memorial Hospital [the President and
         the Governor were rushed to this hospital after the
         shooting] and the two bullet fragments found on the front
         seat of the Presidential limousine were fired from the 6.5-
         millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found on the sixth floor
         of the Depository Building to the exclusion of all other
         weapons.
            The three used cartridge cases found near the window on
         the sixth floor at the southeast corner of the building were
         fired from the same rifle which fired the above-described
         bullet and fragments, to the exclusion of all other weapons.
         (R18)

         Here the Commission has related a rifle and three spent
      cartridge cases found at the scene of the crime to a bullet found
      in a location presumably occupied by Governor Connally as well as
      to fragments found in the car in which both victims rode.  The
      circumstantial aspect of the ballistics evidence presented by the
      Commission is this:  it does not directly relate the weapon to a
      specific shooter nor the bullet specimens to a specific victim's
      body.


      {Autopsy}

         An autopsy is a central piece of evidence in violent or
      unnatural death.  In the case of death by gunshot wounds, an
      autopsy can reveal a wealth of information, indicating the type(s)
      of ammunition used by the assailant(s), as well as the general
      relationship of the gun to the victim's body.  Bullets or fragments
      found in the body can sometimes conclusively establish the specific
      weapon used in the crime.  The medical evidence used by the
      Commission emanated from (a) the doctors who observed the
      President's and the Governor's wounds at Parkland Hospital, (b) the
      autopsy on the President performed at the Bethesda Naval Hospital,
      Maryland, on the night of the assassination, (c) the clothing worn
      by the two victims, and (d) ballistics tests conducted with the
      Carcano found in the Depository and ammunition of the same type as
      that found in the hospital and the car.  From this information the
      Commission drew the following conclusions:

            The nature of the bullet wounds suffered by President
         Kennedy and Governor Connally and the location of the car at
         the time of the shots establish that the bullets were fired
         from above and behind the Presidential limousine, striking
         the President and the Governor as follows:
            (1) President Kennedy was first struck by a bullet which
         entered at the back of his neck and exited through the lower
         front portion of his neck, causing a wound which would not
         necessarily have been lethal.  The President was struck a
         second time by a bullet which entered the right-rear portion
         of his head, causing a massive and fatal wound.
            (2) Governor Connally was struck by a bullet which
         entered on the right side of his back and travelled downward
         through the right side of his chest, exiting below his right
         nipple.  This bullet then passed through his right wrist and
         entered his left thigh where it caused a superficial wound.
         (R18-19)

      For each set of wounds, the Report cites ballistics tests in
      support of the notion that the injuries observed were consistent
      with bullets fired from the Carcano (R87, 91, 94-95).  In two
      instances it is asserted that the tests further indicated that the
      wounds could have been produced by the bullet specimens traceable
      to the {specific} Carcano found in the Depository, as opposed to
      merely being consistent with a {similar} rifle firing similar
      ammunition (R87, 95).


      {The Trajectory}

         "The trajectory" is the next topic of discussion in the Report,
      which says:  " . . . to insure that all data were consistent with
      the shots having been fired from the sixth floor window, the
      Commission requested additional investigation, including analysis
      of motion picture films of the assassination and on-site tests"
      (R96).  The films referred to by the Commission were those taken of
      the assassination by spectators Abraham Zapruder, Orville Nix, and
      Mary Muchmore.  Only Zapruder's film, taken from the President's
      side of the street, provided a photographic record of the entire
      shooting.  (Zapruder's position is shown in the sketch of Dealey
      Plaza.)
         Motion picture footage is composed of a series of still pictures
      called "frames" taken in extremely rapid succession which, when
      projected at approximately the same speed of exposure, create the
      illusion of motion.  The frames of the Zapruder film were numbered
      by the FBI for convenient reference, and it is not until frame 130
      that the President's car appears in the film.  From that point on,
      this is basically what we see in terms of frames:  The car
      continues down Elm for a brief period, gradually approaching a road
      sign that loomed in Zapruder's view.  At frame 210, President
      Kennedy goes out of view behind this sign.  Governor Connally, also
      temporarily blocked from Zapruder's sight, first reappears in frame
      222.  At 225 the President comes into view again, and he has
      obviously been wounded, for his face has a grimace and his hands
      are rising toward his chin.  Within about ten frames, the Governor
      is struck;  he manifests a violent reaction.  In the succeeding
      frames we see Mrs. Kennedy reach over to help her husband, her
      attention temporarily diverted by Connally, who is screaming.
      Finally, at frame 313, the President is struck in the head, as can
      be clearly seen by the great rupturing of skull and brain tissues.
      Mrs. Kennedy scrambles frantically onto the trunk of the limousine
      and is forced back into her seat by a Secret Service agent who had
      run to the car from the follow-up vehicle.  Subsequent to the head
      shot, the limousine accelerated in its approach toward the
      underpass.  Once the car is out of view, the film stops.  The Nix
      and Muchmore films depict sequences immediately before, during, and
      after the head shot.
         Examination of Zapruder's camera by the FBI established that an
      average of 18.3 film frames was exposed during each second of
      operation;  thus the timing of certain events could be calculated
      by allowing 1/18.3 seconds for the action depicted from one frame
      to the next.  Tests of the "assassin's" rifle disclosed that at
      least 2.3 seconds (or 41-42 film frames) were required between
      shots (R97).
         The on-site tests were conducted by the FBI and Secret Service
      in Dealey Plaza on May 24, 1964.  A car simulating the Presidential
      limousine was driven down Elm Street, as depicted in the various
      assassination films, with stand-ins occupying the general positions
      of the President and the Governor.  An agent situated in the
      sixth-floor window tracked the car through the telescopic sight on
      the Carcano as the assassin allegedly did on November 22.  Films
      depicting the "assassin's view" were made through the rifle scope
      (R97).  During these tests it was ascertained that the foliage of a
      live oak tree would have blocked a sixth-floor view of the
      President during his span of travel corresponding to frames 166
      through 210.  An opening among the leaves permitted viewing the
      President's back at frame 186, for a duration of about 1/18 second
      (R98).
         The Commission concluded that the first shot to wound the
      President in the neck occurred between frames 210 to 225, largely
      because (a) a sixth-floor gunman could not have shot at the
      President for a substantial time prior to 210 because of the tree,
      and (b) the President seems to show an obvious reaction to his neck
      wounds at 225.  Exact determination of the time of impact was
      prevented because Mr. Kennedy was blocked from Zapruder's view by a
      road sign from 210 to 224 (R98, 105).
         The Report next argues that the trajectory from the sixth-floor
      window strongly indicated that a bullet exiting from the
      President's throat and traveling at a substantial velocity would
      not have missed both the car and its occupants.  No damage to the
      limousine was found consistent with the impact of such a missile.
      "Since [the bullet] did not hit the automobile, [FBI expert]
      Frazier testified that it probably struck Governor Connally," says
      the Report, adding, "The relative positions of President Kennedy
      and Governor Connally at the time when the President was struck in
      the neck confirm that the same bullet probably passed through both
      men" (R105). The evidence allegedly supporting this double-hit
      theory is then discussed, and the Commission concludes that one
      bullet probably was responsible for all the nonfatal wounds to the
      two victims (R19).


      {Number of Shots}

         "The weight of the evidence indicates that there were three
      shots fired," declares the Report (R19).  This conclusion is based
      not so much on witness recollections as on the physical evidence at
      the scene--namely, the presence of three cartridge cases (R110-11).
      The Commission reasons that, because (a) one shot passed through
      the President's neck and probably went on to wound the Governor,
      (b) a subsequent shot penetrated the President's head, (c) no other
      shot struck the car, and (d) three shots were fired, "it follows
      that one shot probably missed the car and its occupants.  The
      evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first, second, or
      third shot which missed" (R111).


      {Time Span}

         Determination of the time span of the shots, according to the
      Commission's theory, is dependent on which of the three shots
      missed.  As calculated by use of the Zapruder film, the time span
      from the first shot to wound the President to the one that killed
      him was 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.  Had the missed shot occurred between
      these two, says the Report, all the shots could still have been
      fired from the Carcano, which required at least 2.3 seconds (or 42
      frames) between successive shots.  If the first or third shots
      missed, the time span grows to at least 7.1 to 7.9 seconds for the
      three shots.
         Thus, the Commission concluded

         that the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded
         Governor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at
         the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository
         Building.  Two bullets probably caused all the wounds
         suffered by President Kennedy and Governor Connally.  Since
         the preponderance of the evidence indicated that three shots
         were fired, the Commission concluded that one shot probably
         missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants, and
         that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging
         from approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds. (R117)



      {The Assassin}

         In a preface to its discussion of the evidence relevant to the
      identity of President Kennedy's assassin, the Report adds a new
      conclusion to those of its preceding chapter.  Here it asserts not
      only that it has established the source of the shots as the
      specific Depository window, but also "that the weapon which fired
      [the] bullets was a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle
      bearing the serial number C2766" (R118).  Although it had
      previously traced the found bullet specimens to this rifle
      discovered in the Depository, the Report never specifically
      concluded that these bullets were responsible for the wounds.
      Making such an assertion at this point provided the premise for
      associating the owner of that rifle with the murder.
         Who owned the rifle?  The Report announces:

         Having reviewed the evidence that (1) Lee Harvey Oswald
         purchased the rifle used in the assassination [although the
         name under which the rifle was ordered was "A.  Hidell," the
         order forms were in Oswald's handwriting (R118-119)], (2)
         Oswald's palmprint was on the rifle in a position which
         shows that he had handled it while it was disassembled, (3)
         fibers found on the rifle most probably came from the shirt
         Oswald was wearing on the day of the assassination [although
         the Commission's expert felt that these fibers had been
         picked up "in the recent past," he could not say definitely
         how long they had adhered to the rifle (R125)].  The
         Commission never considered the possibility that they were
         deposited on the rifle subsequent to Oswald's arrest.], (4)
         a photograph taken in the yard of Oswald's apartment shows
         him holding this rifle [the photographic expert could render
         no opinion as to whether the rifle shown in these pictures
         was the C2766 and not another rifle of the same
         configuration (R127)], and (5) the rifle was kept among
         Oswald's possessions from the time of its purchase until the
         day of the assassination [The Commission cites no evidence
         that the specific C2766 rifle was in Oswald's possession.],
         the Commission concluded that the rifle used to assassinate
         President Kennedy and wound Governor Connally was owned and
         possessed by Lee Harvey Oswald. (R129)

         At this point the Commission has related Oswald to the
      President's murder in two ways.  It has posited the source of the
      shots at a location accessible to Oswald, and has named as the
      assassination weapon a rifle purchased and possibly possessed by
      Oswald.  This, although circumstantial, obviously laid the
      foundation for the ultimate conclusion that Oswald was the
      assassin.  Now his activities on the day of the shooting had to be
      considered in light of this charge.
         In a section headed "The Rifle in the Building," the Report
      takes up the problem of how the C2766 rifle was brought into the
      Depository.  The search for an answer was not difficult for the
      Commission.  Between Thursday night, November 21, and Friday
      morning, Oswald had engaged in what could have been construed as
      incriminating behavior.  As the Report explains,

            During October and November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald
         lived in a roominghouse in Dallas while his wife and
         children lived in Irving, at the home of Ruth Paine,
         approximately 15 miles from Oswald's place of work at the .
         . . Depository.  Oswald travelled between Dallas and Irving
         on weekends in a car driven by a neighbor of the Paine's,
         Buell Wesley Frazier, who also worked at the Depository.
         Oswald generally would go to Irving on Friday afternoon and
         return to Dallas Monday morning. (R129)

         On Thursday, November 21, Oswald asked Frazier whether he could
      ride home with him to Irving that afternoon, saying that he had to
      pick up some curtain rods for his apartment.  The Report would lead
      us to believe that Oswald's Irving visit on the day prior to the
      assassination was a departure from his normal schedule.  Adding
      further suspicion to this visit, the Report asserts "It would
      appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was not the purpose of
      Oswald's trip to Irving on November 21," noting that Oswald's
      apartment, according to his landlady, did not need curtains or
      rods, and no curtain rods were discovered in the Depository after
      the assassination (R130).
         By seeming to disprove Oswald's excuse for the weekday trip to
      Irving, the Report establishes a basis for more sinister
      explanations;  they hinge on the assumption that the rifle was
      stored in the Paine garage.  Asserting that Oswald had the
      opportunity to enter the garage Thursday night without being
      detected, the Report emphasizes that, by the afternoon of November
      22 the rifle was missing from "its accustomed place."  The
      implication is that Oswald removed it (R130-31).
         To top off this progression of hypotheses is the fact that
      Oswald carried a "long and bulky package" to work on the morning of
      the assassination.  As he walked to Frazier's house for a ride to
      the Depository, Frazier's sister, Linnie May Randle, saw him
      carrying a package that she estimated to be about 28 inches long
      and 8 inches wide.  Frazier was the next to see the brown paper
      container, as he got into the car and again as he and Oswald walked
      toward the Depository after parking in a nearby lot.  He thought
      the package was around 2 feet long and 5 or 6 inches wide,
      recalling that Oswald held it cupped in his right hand with the
      upper end wedged in his right armpit.  The Report expresses its
      apparent exasperation that both Frazier's and Mrs. Randle's
      estimates and descriptions were of a package shorter than the
      longest component of the Carcano which, when disassembled, is 34.8
      inches in length.  It asserts that "Mrs. Randle saw the bag
      fleetingly" and quotes Frazier as saying that he paid it little
      attention, and concludes that the two "are mistaken as to the
      length of the bag" (R131-34).  Had they not been "mistaken" in
      their recollections, Oswald's package could not have contained the
      rifle.
         "A handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape was found in the
      southeast corner of the sixth floor along-side the window from
      which the shots were fired (R134)," says the Report, citing
      scientific evidence that this bag was (a) made from materials
      obtained in the Depository's shipping room, and (b) handled by
      Oswald so that he left a palmprint and fingerprint on it.  After
      connecting this sack with the "assassin's" window and Oswald, the
      Report attempts a further connection with the rifle by asserting
      that some fibers found inside the bag matched some of those which
      composed the blanket in which the rifle was allegedly stored,
      suggesting that perhaps the rifle "picked up the fibers from the
      blanket and transferred them to the paper bag."  This feeble
      evidence is all the Commission could produce to suggest a
      connection between the rifle and the bag.  A Commission staff
      lawyer, Wesley Liebeler, called it "very thin."[1]  Likewise, the
      Commission asserts that Oswald {constructed} this bag, while it
      presents evidence only that he {handled} it (R134-37).
         One may indeed express concern that, on the basis of the above-
      cited evidence, the Commission asserts, "The preponderance of the
      evidence supports the conclusions that" Oswald:  "(1) told the
      curtain rod story to Frazier to explain both the return to Irving
      on a Thursday and the obvious bulk of the package he intended to
      bring to work the next day," even though no explanation other than
      the transporting of the rifle was considered by the Commission
      (e.g., that perhaps Oswald told the "curtain rod story" to Frazier
      to cover a personal reason such as making up with his wife, with
      whom he had quarreled earlier that week, bringing a large package
      the following morning to substantiate the false excuse);  "(2) took
      paper and tape from the wrapping bench of the Depository and
      fashioned a bag large enough to carry the disassembled rifle,"
      although no evidence is offered that Oswald ever constructed the
      bag;  "(3) removed the rifle from the Paine's garage on Thursday
      evening," citing no evidence that it might not have been someone
      other than Oswald who removed the rifle, if it was ever there at
      all;  "(4) carried the rifle into the Depository Building,
      concealed in the bag," even though, to make this assertion, it had
      to reject the stories of the only witnesses who saw the package,
      and could produce no direct evidence that the rifle had been in the
      bag;  and "(5) left the bag alongside the window from which the
      shots were fired," offering no substantiation that it was Oswald
      who left the bag in this position (R137).  The Commission's
      conclusion from this evidence is that "Oswald carried [his] rifle
      into the Depository building on the morning of November 22, 1963"
      (R19), although the prefabrication of the bag demands premeditation
      of the murder, and the presence of the bag by the "assassin's"
      window implies, according to the Report, that Oswald brought the
      rifle to this window.
         Because its logic was faulty, the Commission's interpretation of
      "the preponderance of the evidence" loses substantial foundation.
      Not one of the five above-quoted subconclusions relating to the
      rifle in the building is confirmed by evidence;  a conclusive
      determination is precluded by insufficient evidence.  The most the
      Commission could fairly have asserted from the facts presented is
      that, although there was no conclusive evidence that Oswald brought
      his rifle to the Depository, there was likewise no conclusive
      disproof, that is, the state of the evidence could not dictate a
      reliable conclusion.
         As the Commission edged toward its ultimate conclusion that
      Oswald was the lone assassin, it reached a comfortable position in
      having concluded that Oswald brought his rifle to the Depository.
      It next had to consider the question of Oswald's presence at the
      right window at the right time.  Assured that Oswald "worked
      principally on the first and sixth floors of the building," we
      learn that "the Commission evaluated the physical evidence found
      near the window after the assassination and the testimony of
      eyewitnesses in deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald was present at
      this window at the time of the assassination" (R137).
         The Report presents only one form of "physical evidence"--
      fingerprints--asserting that a total of four of Oswald's prints
      were left on two boxes near the window and on the paper sack found
      in that area.  In evaluating the significance of this evidence,

         the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald
         handled these cartons as part of his normal duties. . . .
         Although a person could handle a carton and not leave
         identifiable prints, none of these employees [who might have
         handled the cartons] except Oswald left identifiable prints
         on the cartons.  This finding, in addition to the freshness
         of one of the prints . . . led the Commission to attach some
         probative value to the fingerprint and palmprint
         identifications in reaching the conclusion that Oswald was
         present at the window from which the shots were fired,
         although the prints do not establish the exact time he was
         there. (R141)

         The Report's reasoning is that the presence of Oswald's prints
      on objects present at the sixth-floor window is probative evidence
      of his presence at this window at some time.  Liebeler felt that
      this evidence "seems to have very little significance indeed," and
      pointed out that the absence of other employees' fingerprints "does
      not help to convince me that [Oswald] moved [the boxes] in
      connection with the assassination.  It shows the opposite just as
      well."[2]  Both Liebeler and the Report avoid the logical, and the
      only precise, meaning of these fingerprint data:  the presence of
      Oswald's prints on the cartons and the bag means {only} that he
      handled them;  it does not disclose {when} or {where}.  Oswald
      {could} have touched these objects on the first floor of the
      Depository prior to the time when they were moved to their location
      by the "assassin's" window, perhaps by another person.  Thus, this
      evidence does not connect Oswald with the source of the shots and
      is meaningless, because Oswald normally handled such cartons in the
      building as part of his work.
         "Additional testimony linking Oswald with the point from which
      the shots were fired was provided by the testimony of Charles
      Givens," the Report continues, "who was the last known employee to
      see Oswald inside the building prior to the assassination."
      According to the Report, Givens saw Oswald walking {away} from the
      southeast corner of the sixth floor at 11:55, 35 minutes before the
      shooting (R143).  That Oswald was seen where he normally worked
      such a substantial amount of the time prior to the shots connects
      him with nothing except his expected routine.  That "none of the
      Depository employees is known to have seen Oswald again until after
      the shooting," if true, is likewise of little significance,
      especially since most of the employees had left the building to
      view the motorcade.
         In its next section relevant to the discussion of "Oswald at
      Window," the Report--best expressed in colloquial terms--"pulls a
      fast one."  This section is entitled "Eyewitness Identification of
      Assassin," but contains {no} identification accepted by the
      Commission (R143-49).  The first eyewitness mentioned is Howard
      Brennan who, 120 feet from the window, said he saw a man fire at
      the President.  "During the evening of November 22, Brennan
      identified Oswald as the person in the [police] lineup who bore the
      closest resemblance to the man in the window but said he was unable
      to make a positive identification."  Prior to this lineup, Brennan
      had seen Oswald's picture on television.  In the months before his
      Warren Commission testimony, Brennan underwent some serious changes
      of heart.  A month after the assassination he was suddenly positive
      that the man he saw was Oswald.  Three weeks later, he was again
      unable to make a positive identification.  In two months, when he
      appeared before the Commission, he was again ready to swear that
      the man was Oswald, claiming to have been capable of such an
      identification all along.  Brennan's vacillation on the crucial
      matter of identifying Oswald renders all of his varying statements
      unworthy of credence.  The Report recognized the worthlessness of
      Brennan's after-the-fact identification, although it managed to use
      his testimony for the most it could yield:

            Although the record indicates that Brennan was an
         accurate observer, he declined to make a positive
         identification of Oswald when he first saw him in the police
         lineup.  {The Commission therefore, does not base its
         conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin on
         Brennan's subsequent certain identification of Lee Harvey
         Oswald as the man he saw fire the rifle}. . . .  The
         Commission is satisfied that . . . Brennan saw a man in the
         window who closely resembled . . . Oswald. (R145-46;
         emphasis added)

      If the Commission did not base its conclusion as to Oswald's
      presence at the window on Brennan's identification, upon whose
      "eyewitness identification of assassin" did it rely?  Under this
      section it presents three additional witnesses who saw a man in the
      window, all of whom gave sketchy descriptions, and {none} of whom
      were able to identify the man.  Thus, the Report, having rejected
      Brennan's story, could offer {no} eyewitness capable of identifying
      the assassin.
         In pulling its "fast one," the Commission sticks to its
      justified rejection of Brennan's identification for only 11 pages
      for, when the conclusion to the "Oswald at Window" section is
      drawn, his incredible identification is suddenly accepted.  Here
      the Commission concludes "that Oswald, at the time of the
      assassination, was present at the window from which the shots were
      fired" on the basis of findings stipulated above.  One of these
      "findings" involves "an eyewitness to the shooting" who "identified
      Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the man he saw
      and later identified Oswald as the man he observed" (R156).
      Through this double standard the Report manifests itself to be no
      more credible than Brennan.
         "In considering whether Oswald was at the southeast corner
      window at the time the shots were fired, the Commission . . .
      reviewed the testimony of witnesses who saw Oswald in the building
      within minutes after the assassination" (R149).  Immediately after
      the shots, Patrolman M. L. Baker, riding a motorcycle in the
      procession, drove to a point near the front entrance of the
      Depository, entered the building, and sought assistance in reaching
      the roof, for he "had it in mind that the shots came from the top
      of this building."  He met manager Roy Truly, and the two ran up
      the steps toward the roof.  Baker stopped on the second floor and
      saw Oswald entering the lunchroom there.  This encounter in the
      lunchroom presented a problem to the Commission:

            In an effort to determine whether Oswald could have
         descended to the lunchroom from the sixth floor by the time
         Baker and Truly arrived Commission counsel asked Baker and
         Truly to repeat their movements from the time of the shot
         until Baker came upon Oswald in the lunchroom. . . .  On the
         first test, the elapsed time between the simulated first
         shot and Baker's arrival on the second-floor stair landing
         was one minute and 30 seconds.  The second test run required
         one minute and 15 seconds.
            A test was also conducted to determine the time required
         to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the
         second-floor lunchroom by stairway [Oswald could not have
         used the elevator.]. . . .  The first test, run at normal
         walking pace, required one minute, 18 seconds;  the second
         test, at a "fast walk" took one minute, 14 seconds. (R152)

      Thus, as presented in the Report, these tests could prove that
      Oswald was {not} at the sixth-floor window, for had his time of
      descent been one minute, 18 seconds and Baker's time of ascent been
      one minute, {14} seconds, Oswald would have arrived at the
      lunchroom {after} Baker, which was not the case on November 22.
      Recognizing this, the Report assures us that the reconstruction of
      Baker's movements was invalid in that it failed to simulate actions
      that would have lengthened Baker's time.  Thus, it is able to
      conclude "that Oswald could have fired the shots and still have
      been present in the second floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and
      Truly" (R152-53).
         Here the Commission is playing games.  It tells us that its
      reconstructions could support or destroy the assumption of Oswald's
      presence at the window.  This point is crucial in determining the
      identity of the assassin, for it could potentially have provided
      Oswald with an alibi.  Instead of conducting the tests properly,
      the Commission tells us that it neglected to simulate some of
      Baker's actions, and on the premise that its test was invalid,
      draws a conclusion incriminating Oswald.  One of the factors
      mentioned by the Report as influencing the conclusion that Oswald
      was at the window is that his actions after the assassination "are
      consistent with" his having been there.  Because the premise of an
      invalid reconstruction makes debatable any inferences drawn from
      it, and because Oswald's actions after the shooting were consistent
      with his having been almost {anywhere} in the building, this aspect
      of the Report's conclusion is a {non sequitur}.
         The Report ultimately attempts to combine its four logically
      deficient arguments in support of the conclusion that Oswald was
      present during the assassination at the window from which the shots
      were fired.  The facts presented are not sufficient to support such
      a conclusion.  The fingerprint evidence does not place Oswald at
      that window, for the objects on which he left prints were mobile
      and therefore may have been in a location other than the window
      when he handled them.  That someone saw Oswald near this area 35
      minutes before the shots does not mean he was there during the
      shots, nor does the alleged fact that no one else saw Oswald
      eliminate the possibility of his having been elsewhere.  The one
      witness who claimed to have seen Oswald in the window could do so
      only at intervals, rendering his story incredible.  Oswald's
      actions after the assassination do not place him at any specific
      location during the shots and might even preclude his having been
      at the window.
         The only fair conclusion from the facts presented is that there
      is no evidence that Oswald was at the window at the time of the
      assassination.
         At this point in the development of the Commission's case,
      Oswald "officially" possessed the murder weapon, brought it to the
      Depository on the day of the assassination, and was present at the
      "assassin's" window during the shots.  There would seem to be only
      one additional consideration relevant to the proof of his guilt:
      his capability with a rifle.  This issue is addressed only after
      several unrelated matters are considered.
         The Commission's conclusion that Oswald was the assassin is not
      based on a constant set of considerations.  The chapter "The
      Assassin" draws its conclusion from eight factors (R195).  The
      chapter "Summary and Conclusions" omits two of these factors and
      adds another.  The eight-part conclusion states that:

            On the basis of the evidence reviewed in this chapter the
         Commission has found that Lee Harvey Oswald (1) owned and
         possessed the rifle used to kill President Kennedy and wound
         Governor Connally, (2) brought this rifle to the Depository
         Building on the morning of the assassination, (3) was
         present, at the time of the assassination, at the window
         from which the shots were fired, (4) killed Dallas Police
         Officer J. D. Tippit in an apparent attempt to escape, (5)
         resisted arrest by drawing a fully loaded pistol and
         attempting to shoot another police officer, (6) lied to the
         police after his arrest concerning important substantive
         matters, (7) attempted, in April 1963, to kill Major General
         Edwin A. Walker, and (8) possessed the capability with a
         rifle which would have enabled him to commit the
         assassination.  On the basis of these findings the
         Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was the
         assassin of President Kennedy. (R195)

      Obviously, considerations 4, 5, 6, and 7 do not relate to the
      question of whether Oswald did or did not pull the trigger of the
      gun that killed the President and wounded the Governor.  In the
      alternate version of the Commission's conclusions, 4 and 5 are
      omitted from the factors upon which the guilty "verdict" is based.
      Added in this section is the consideration that the Mannlicher-
      Carcano and the paper sack were found on the sixth floor subsequent
      to the shooting (R19-20).
         "In deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots . . .,"
      says the Report, "the Commission considered whether Oswald, using
      his own rifle, possessed the capability to hit his target with two
      out of three shots under the conditions described in Chapter III
      [concerning the source of the shots]" (R189).  The Commission's
      previous conclusions leave little room for an assertion other than
      one indicating that Oswald had the capability to fire the
      assassination shots.  If he could not have done this from lack of
      sufficient skill, the other factors seeming to relate him to the
      assassination will have to be accounted for by some other
      explanation.
         First considered under this section is the nature of the shots
      (R189-91).  Several experts are quoted as saying that the shots,
      fired at ranges of 177 to 266 feet and employing a four-power
      scope, were "not . . . particularly difficult" and "very easy."
      However, in no case did the experts take into account the time
      element involved in the assassination shots.  Without this
      consideration, Wesley Liebeler could not understand the basis for
      any conclusion on the nature of the shots.  He wrote:

            The section on the nature of the shots deals basically
         with the range and the effect of a telescopic sight.
         Several experts conclude that the shots were easy.  There
         is, however, no consideration given here to the time allowed
         for the shots.  I do not see how someone can conclude that a
         shot is easy or hard unless he knows something about how
         long the firer has to shoot, i.e., how much time is allotted
         for the shots.[3]

      Liebeler's criticism had no effect on the final report, which
      ignores the time question in evaluating the nature of the shots.
      The evaluation of the shots as "easy" should therefore be
      considered void and all inferences based on it at best
      questionable.
         In considering "Oswald's Marine Training," the Report deceives
      its readers by use of common and frequent {non sequiturs}.  First
      it includes, as relevant to Oswald's {rifle} capability, his
      training in the use of weapons other than rifles, such as pistols
      and shotguns.  Of this Liebeler said bluntly, "That is completely
      irrevelant to the question of his ability to fire a rifle. . . .
      It is, furthermore, prejudicial to some extent."[4]  The Report
      then reveals with total dispassion Oswald's official Marine Corps
      evaluation based on firing tests:  when first tested in the
      Marines, Oswald was "a fairly good shot";  on the basis of his last
      recorded test he was a {"rather poor shot."}  A Marine marksmanship
      expert who had absolutely no association with Oswald is next quoted
      as offering various excuses for the "poor shot" rating, including
      bad weather and lack of motivation.  No substantiation in any form
      is put forth to buttress these "excuses."  As the record presented
      in the Report stands, Oswald left the Marines a "fairly poor shot."
      However, the unqualified use of the expert's unsubstantiated
      hypothesizing gives the impression that Oswald was not such a "poor
      shot."  On the basis of this questionable premise, the Report
      quotes more experts who, in meaningless comparisons, contradicted
      the official evaluation of Oswald's performance with a rifle and
      called him "a good to excellent shot" (R191-92).  One may indeed
      question the state of our national "defense" when "rather poor
      shots" from the Marines are considered "excellent" marksmen.
         In discussing "Oswald's Rifle Practice Outside the Marines"
      (R192-93), the Report cites a total of 11 instances in which Oswald
      could be physically associated with a firearm.  Most of these
      instances involved hunting trips, six of which took place in the
      Soviet Union.  However, as Liebeler pointed out in his critical
      memorandum, Oswald used a shotgun when hunting in Russia.
      Liebeler's concern can be sensed in his question "Under what theory
      do we include activities concerning a {shotgun} under a heading
      relating to {rifle} practice, and then presume not to advise the
      reader of that?"[5]  The latest time the Report places a weapon in
      Oswald's hands is May 1963, when his wife, Marina, said he
      practiced operating the bolt and looking through the scope {on a
      screened porch at night}.  Liebeler thought "the support for that
      proposition is thin indeed," adding that "Marina Oswald first
      testified that she did not know what he was doing out there and
      then she was clearly led into the only answer that gives any
      support to this proposition."[6]  The Report evoked its own
      support, noting that the cartridge cases found in the Depository
      "had been previously loaded and ejected from the assassination
      rifle, which would indicate that Oswald practiced opening the
      bolt."  Marks on these cases could not show that {Oswald,} to the
      exclusion of all other people, loaded and ejected the cases.
         In the end, the Commission was able to cite only two instances
      in which Oswald handled the Carcano, both based on Marina's tenuous
      assertions.  It produced {no} evidence that Oswald ever fired his
      rifle.  Despite this and the other major gaps in its arguments, the
      Report concludes that "Oswald's Marine training in marksmanship,
      his other rifle experience and his established familiarity with
      this particular weapon show that he possessed ample capability to
      commit the assassination" (R195).  Because the Report offers no
      evidence to support it, this conclusion is necessarily dishonest.
      Liebeler cautioned the Commission on this point but was apparently
      ignored.  He wrote:

            The statements concerning Oswald's practice with the
         assassination weapon are misleading.  They tend to give the
         impression that he did more practicing than the record
         suggests he did.  My recollection is that there is only one
         specific time when he might have practiced.  We should be
         more precise in this area, because the Commission is going
         to have its work in this area examined very closely.[7]

         That a shooter can be only as good as the weapon he fires is a
      much-repeated expression.  In fact, the proficiency of the shooter
      and the quality of his shooting apparatus combine to affect the
      outcome of the shot.  To test the accuracy of the assassination
      rifle, the Commission did not put the weapon in the hands of one
      whose marksmanship was as "poor" as Oswald's and whose known
      practice prior to firing was virtually nil.  Its test firers were
      all experts--men whose daily routines involved working with and
      shooting firearms.  Liebeler, as a member of the Commission's
      investigatory staff, was one of the severest critics of the rifle
      tests.  The following paragraphs, again from Liebeler's memorandum,
      provide a good analysis of those tests as represented in the
      Report:

            As I read through the section on rifle capability it
         appears that 15 different sets of three shots were fired by
         supposedly expert riflemen of the FBI and other places.
         According to my calculations those 15 sets of shots took a
         total of 93.8 seconds to be fired.  The average of all 15 is
         a little over 6.2 seconds.  Assuming that time calculated is
         commencing with the firing of the first shot, that means the
         average time it took to fire two remaining shots was about
         6.2 seconds.  That comes to about 3.1 seconds for each shot,
         not counting the time consumed by the actual firing, which
         would not be very much.  I recall that Chapter Three said
         that the minimum time that had to elapse between shots was
         2.25 seconds, which is pretty close to the one set of fast
         shots fired by Frazier of the FBI.
            The conclusion indicates that Oswald had the capability
         to fire 3 shots with two hits in from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.
         Of the fifteen sets of three shots described above, only
         {three} were fired within 4.8 seconds.  A total of five
         sets, including the three just mentioned, were fired within
         a total of 5.6 seconds.  The conclusion at its most extreme
         states Oswald could fire faster than the Commission experts
         fired in 12 of their 15 tries and that in any event he could
         fire faster than the experts did in 10 out of their 15
         tries. . . .
            The problems raised by the above analysis should be met
         at some point in the text of the Report.  The figure of 2.25
         as a minimum firing time for each shot is used throughout
         Chapter 3.  The present discussion of rifle capability shows
         that expert riflemen could not fire the assassination weapon
         that fast.  Only one of the experts managed to do so, and
         his shots, like those of the other FBI experts, were high
         and to the right of the target.  The fact is that most of
         the experts were much more proficient with a rifle than
         Oswald could ever be expected to be, and the record
         indicates that fact.[8]

      Despite the obvious meaning of Liebeler's analysis, the rifle tests
      are used in the Report to buttress the notion that it was within
      Oswald's capability to fire the assassination shots (R195).  The
      kindest thing that can be said of this one-sided presentation of
      the evidence was written by Liebeler himself:  "To put it bluntly,
      that sort of selection from the record could seriously affect the
      integrity and credibility of the entire Report. . . .  These
      conclusions will never be accepted by critical persons anyway."[9]
         The only possible conclusion warranted by the evidence set forth
      in the Report is that Oswald left the Marines a "rather poor shot"
      and, unless a major aspect of his life within a few months prior to
      the assassination has been so well concealed as not to emerge
      through the efforts of several investigative teams, he did not
      engage in any activities sufficient to improve his proficiency with
      his weapon to the extent of enabling him to murder the President
      and wound the Governor unaided.
         This is the official case, the development of the "proof" that
      Oswald, alone and unaided, committed the assassination.  To avoid
      the detailed discussion required for a rebuttal, I have assumed
      that the source of the shots was as the Commission postulated--the
      sixth-floor window of the Depository, from "Oswald's rifle."
         This was as far as the Commission could go in relation to the
      question of Oswald's guilt.  Obviously, the use of his rifle in the
      crime does not mean he fired it.  The Commission offers, in
      essence, {no} evidence that Oswald brought his rifle to the
      Depository, {no} evidence that Oswald was present at the window
      during the shots, and {no} evidence that Oswald had the capability
      to have fired the shots.  This is not to say that such evidence
      does not exist, but that none is presented in the Report.  That,
      for the scope of this chapter's analysis, is significant.
         The Commission's conclusion that Oswald was the assassin is
      invalid because it is, from beginning to end, a {non sequitur}.
      This analysis of the derivation of that conclusion, based solely on
      the evidence presented in the Report, demonstrates that evidence to
      be without logical relationship, used by the Commission in total
      disregard of logic.  The Report's continued fabrication of false
      premises from which are drawn invalid inferences is consistent with
      one salient factor:  that the Commission evaluated the evidence
      relating to the assassin's identity on the presumption that Oswald
      alone was guilty.

      Presumed Guilty:  The Official Disposition




      The discussion in chapter 1 did not disprove the Commission's
      conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President Kennedy.
      It merely showed that, based on the evidence presented in the
      Report, Oswald's guilt was presumed, not established.  The
      Commission argued a case that is logical only on the premise that
      Oswald alone was guilty.
         The official assurance is, as is to be expected, the opposite.
      In the Foreword to its Report, the Commission assures us that it
      "has functioned neither as a court presiding over an adversary
      proceeding nor as a prosecutor determined to prove a case, but as a
      fact finding agency committed to the ascertainment of the truth"
      (Rxiv).  This is to say that neither innocence nor guilt was
      presumed from the outset of the inquiry, in effect stating that the
      Commission conducted a "chips-fall-where-they-may" investigation.
         At no time after a final bullet snuffed out the life of the
      young President did {any} agency conduct an investigation not based
      on the premise of Oswald's guilt.  Despite the many noble
      assurances of impartiality, the fact remains that from the time
      when he was in police custody, Oswald was officially thought to be
      Kennedy's sole assassin.  In violation of his every right and as a
      guarantee that virtually no citizen would think otherwise, the
      official belief of Oswald's guilt was shamefully offered to a
      public grieved by the violent death of its leader, and anxious to
      find and prosecute the perpetrator of the crime.


      {The Police Presumption}

         Two days after the assassination, the "New York Times" ran a
      banner headline that read, in part, "Police Say Prisoner is the
      Assassin," with a smaller--but likewise front-page--heading,
      "Evidence Against Oswald Described as Conclusive."  The article
      quoted Captain Will Fritz of the Dallas Police Homicide Bureau as
      having said, "We're convinced beyond any doubt that he killed the
      President. . . .  I think the case is cinched."[1]
         Other newspapers echoed the "Times" that day.  The "Philadelphia
      Inquirer" reported:  "Police on Saturday said they have an airtight
      case against pro-Castro Marxist Lee Harvey Oswald as the assassin
      of President Kennedy."[2]  On the front page of the "St. Louis
      Post-Dispatch" was the headline "Dallas Police Insist Evidence
      Proves Oswald Killed Kennedy."

            Dallas police said today that Lee Harvey Oswald . . .
         assassinated President John F. Kennedy and they have the
         evidence to prove it. . . .  "The man killed President
         Kennedy.  We are convinced without any doubt that he did the
         killing.  There were no accomplices," [Captain] Fritz
         asserted.
            Police Chief Jesse E. Curry outlined this web of evidence
         that, he said, showed Oswald was the sniper.[3]

         The following day, November 25, was the occasion for yet another
      banner headline in the "Times."  In one fell swoop, there was no
      longer any doubt;  it was no longer just the Dallas police who were
      prematurely convinced of Oswald's guilt.  "President's Assassin
      Shot to Death in Jail Corridor by a Dallas Citizen," the headline
      proclaimed.  There was no room for such qualifiers as "alleged" or
      "accused."  Yet, in this very issue, the "Times" included a strong
      editorial that criticized the police pronouncement of guilt:

            The Dallas authorities, abetted and encouraged by the
         newspaper, TV and radio press, trampled on every principle
         of justice in their handling of Lee Harvey Oswald. . . .
         The heinousness of the crime Oswald was alleged to have
         committed made it doubly important that there be no cloud
         over the establishment of his guilt.
            Yet--before any indictment had been returned or any
         evidence presented and in the face of continued denials by
         the prisoner--the chief of police and the district attorney
         pronounced Oswald guilty.[4]

      It is unfortunate that this proper condemnation applies equally to
      the source that issued it.
         Transcripts of various police interviews and press conferences
      over the weekend of the assassination (which confirm the above
      newspaper accounts) demonstrate that, in addition to forming a bias
      against Oswald through the press, the police made extensive use of
      the electronic media to spread their improper and premature
      conclusion.
         On Friday night, November 22, NBC-TV broadcast a press interview
      with District Attorney Henry Wade, whose comments included these:
      "I figure we have sufficient evidence to convict him [Oswald] . . .
      there's no one else but him" (24H751).  The next day, Chief Curry,
      though he cautioned that the evidence was not yet "positive," said
      that he was convinced.  In an interview carried by NBC, Curry
      asserted, "Personally, I think we have the right man" (24H754).  In
      another interview broadcast by local station WFAA-TV, Curry was
      asked, "Is there any doubt in your mind, Chief, that Oswald is the
      man who killed the President?"  His response was:  "I think this is
      the man who killed the President" (24H764).  In another interview
      that Saturday, Captain Fritz made the absolute statement:

            There is only one thing that I can tell you without going
         into the evidence before first talking to the District
         Attorney.  I can tell you that this case is cinched--that
         this man killed the President.  There's no question in my
         mind about it. . . .  I don't want to get into the evidence.
         I just want to tell you that we are convinced beyond any
         doubt that he did the killing. (24H787)

         By November 24, Curry's remarks became much stronger.  Local
      station KRLD-TV aired this remark:  "This is the man, we are sure,
      that murdered the patrolman and murdered--assassinated the
      President" (24H772).  Fritz stuck to his earlier conviction that
      Oswald was the assassin (24H788).  Now D.A. Henry Wade joined in
      pronouncing the verdict before trial or indictment:

            WADE:  I would say that without any doubt he's the
         killer--the law says beyond a reasonable doubt and to a
         moral certainty which I--there's no question that he was the
         killer of President Kennedy.
            Q.  That case is closed in your mind?
            WADE:  As far as Oswald is concerned yes. (24H823)



      {The FBI Presumption}

         That same day the FBI announced, contrary to the police
      assertion, that the case was still open and that its investigation,
      begun the day of the shooting, would continue.[5]  This continued
      investigation climaxed after a duration just short of three weeks.
      In a series of contrived news "leaks," the Bureau added to the
      propaganda campaign started by the Dallas Police.
         The decision of the FBI and the Commission was to keep the first
      FBI Summary Report on the assassination secret.[6]  However, even
      prior to the completion of this report, the newspapers carried
      frequent "leaked" stories telling in advance what the report would
      contain.  The Commission met in executive session on December 5,
      1963, and questioned Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach
      about these leaks.  Katzenbach spoke bluntly.  FBI Director Hoover,
      he related, denied that the leaks originated within the FBI, but "I
      say with candor to this committee, I can't think of anybody else it
      could have come from, because I don't know of anybody else that
      knew that information."[7]
         On December 9, Katzenbach transmitted the completed FBI Report
      to the Commission.  In his covering letter of that date, he again
      expressed the Justice Department's desire to keep the Report
      secret, although he felt that "the Commission should consider
      releasing--or allowing the Department of Justice to release--a
      short press statement which would briefly make the following
      points."  Katzenbach wanted the Commission to assure the public
      that the FBI had turned up no evidence of conspiracy and that "the
      FBI report through scientific examination of evidence, testimony
      and intensive investigation, establishes beyond a reasonable doubt
      that Lee Harvey Oswald shot President Kennedy."[8]
         Although the Commission released no such statement, the
      conclusions of which the Justice Department felt the public should
      be informed were widely disseminated by the press, through leaks
      which, according to Katzenbach, must have originated with the FBI.
      On December 1, the "Washington Post" in a major article told its
      readers that "all the police agencies with a hand in the
      investigation . . . insist that [the case against Oswald] is an
      unshakable one."[9]  "Time" magazine, in the week before the FBI
      report was forwarded to the Commission, said of the report, "it
      will indicate that Oswald, acting in his own lunatic loneliness,
      was indeed the President's assassin."[10]  "Newsweek" reported that
      "the report holds to the central conclusion that Federal and local
      probers had long since reached:  that Oswald was the assassin."[11]
      The "New York Times" was privy to the most specific leak concerning
      the FBI report.  On December 10 it ran a front-page story headed
      "Oswald Assassin Beyond a Doubt, FBI Concludes."  This article, by
      Joseph Loftus, began as follows:

            A Federal Bureau of Investigation report went to a
         special Presidential commission today and named Lee H.
         Oswald as the assassin of President Kennedy.
            The Report is known to emphasize that Oswald was beyond
         doubt the assassin and that he acted alone. . . .
            The Department of Justice, declining all comment on the
         content of the report, announced only that on instruction of
         President Johnson the report was sent directly to the
         special Commission.[12]

         All of these news stories, especially that which appeared in the
      "Times," accurately reflect those findings of the FBI report which
      Katzenbach felt should be made public.  The FBI has long claimed
      that it does not draw conclusions in its reports.  The FBI report
      on the assassination disproves this one of many FBI myths.  This
      report {does} draw conclusions, as the press reported.  In the
      preface to this once-secret report (released in 1965), the FBI
      stated:

            Part I briefly relates the assassination of the President
         and the identification of Oswald as his slayer.
            Part II sets forth the evidence conclusively showing that
         Oswald did assassinate the President.  (CD 1)

         The Commission, in secret executive sessions, expressed its
      exasperation at the leak of the FBI report.  On December 16,
      Chairman Warren stated:

            CHAIRMAN:  Well, gentlemen, to be very frank about it, I
         have read that report two or three times and I have not seen
         anything in there yet that has not been in the press.
            SEN. RUSSELL:  I couldn't agree with that more.  I have
         read it through once very carefully, and I went through it
         again at places I had marked, and practically everything in
         there has come out in the press at one time or another, a
         bit here and a bit there.[13]

         It should be noted here that even a casual reading of this FBI
      report and its sequel, the "Supplemental Report" dated January 13,
      1964, discloses that neither establishes Oswald's guilt, nor even
      adequately accounts for all the known facts of the assassination.
      In neither report is there mention of or accounting for the
      President's anterior neck wound which, by the night of November 22,
      was public knowledge around the world.  The Supplemental Report, in
      attempting to associate Oswald with the crime, asserts that a
      full-jacketed bullet traveling at approximately 2,000 feet per
      second stopped short after penetrating "less than a finger length"
      of the President's back.  One need not be an expert to discern that
      this is an impossible event, and indeed later tests confirmed that
      seventy-two inches of flesh were insufficient to stop such a bullet
      (5H78).  The Commission members themselves, in private, grumbled
      about the unsatisfactory nature of the FBI report, as the following
      passage from the December 16 Executive Session reveals:

            MR. MC CLOY:  . . . The grammar is bad and you can see
         they did not polish it all up.  It does leave you some
         loopholes in this thing but I think you have to realize they
         put this thing together very fast.
            REP. BOGGS:  There's nothing in there about Governor
         Connally.
            CHAIRMAN:  No.
            SEN. COOPER:  And whether or not they found any bullets
         in him.
            MR. MC CLOY:  This bullet business leaves me confused.
            CHAIRMAN:  It's totally inconclusive.[14]

         Thus, by January 1964, the American public had been assured by
      both the Dallas Police and the FBI that Oswald was the assassin
      beyond all doubt.  For those who had not taken the time to probe
      the evidence, who were not aware of its inadequacies and
      limitations, such a conclusion was easy to accept.


      {The Commission Presumption}

         Today there can be no doubt that, despite their assurances of
      impartiality, the Commission and its staff consciously planned and
      executed their work under the presumption that Oswald was guilty.
      The once-secret working papers of the Commission explicitly reveal
      the prejudice of the entire investigation.
         General Counsel Rankin did not organize a staff of lawyers under
      him until early in January 1964.  Until that time, the Commission
      had done essentially no work, and had merely received investigative
      reports from other agencies.  Now, Rankin and Warren drew up the
      plans for the organization of the work that the staff was to
      undertake for the Commission.  In a "Progress Report" dated January
      11, from the Chairman to the other members, Warren referred to a
      "tentative outline prepared by Mr. Rankin which I think will assist
      in organizing the evaluation of the investigative materials
      received by the Commission."[15][see Appendix A  -- ratitor]  Two
      subject headings in this outline are of concern here:  "(2) Lee
      Harvey Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy;  (3) Lee Harvey
      Oswald:  Background and Possible Motives."[16]  Thus, it is
      painfully apparent that the Commission did, from the very
      beginning, plan its work with a distinct bias.  It would evaluate
      the evidence from the perspective of "Oswald as the assassin," and
      it would search for his "possible motives."
         Attached to Warren's "Progress Report" was a copy of the
      "Tentative Outline of the Work of the President's Commission."
      This outline reveals in detail the extent to which the conclusion
      of Oswald's guilt was pre-determined.  Section II, "Lee Harvey
      Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy," begins by outlining
      Oswald's movements on the day of the assassination.  Under the
      heading "Murder of Tippit," there is the subheading "Evidence
      demonstrating Oswald's guilt."[17]  Even the FBI had refrained from
      drawing a conclusion as to whether or not Oswald had murdered
      Officer Tippit.  Yet, at this very early point in its
      investigation, the Commission was convinced it could muster
      "evidence demonstrating Oswald's guilt."
         Another heading under Section II of the outline is "Evidence
      Identifying Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy," again a
      presumptive designation made by a commission that had not yet
      analyzed a single bit to evidence.  The listings of evidence under
      this heading are sketchy and hardly conclusive, and further reveal
      the biases of the Commission.  Some of the evidence that was to
      "identify Oswald as the assassin" was "prior similar acts:  a)
      General Walker attack, b) General Eisenhower threat."[18]  Thus we
      learn that Oswald was also presumed guilty in the attempted
      shooting of the right-wing General Walker in April 1963.
         Under the additional heading "Evidence Implicating Others in
      Assassination or Suggesting Accomplices," the Commission was to
      consider only the possibility that others worked with {Oswald} in
      planning or executing the assassination.  The outline further
      reveals that it had been concluded in advance that Oswald had no
      accomplices, for the last category under this heading suggests that
      the evidence be evaluated for the "refutation of allegations."[19]
         The Commission was preoccupied with the question of motive.
      According to the initial outline of its work, it had decided to
      investigate Oswald's motives for killing the President {before} it
      determined whether Oswald had in fact been involved in the
      assassination {in any capacity.}  At the executive session of
      January 21, 1964, an illuminating discussion took place between
      Chairman Warren, General Counsel Rankin, and member Dulles.  Dulles
      wanted to be sure that every possible action was taken to determine
      Oswald's motive:

            Mr. Dulles: I suggested to Mr. Rankin, Mr. Chairman, that
         I thought it would be very useful for us, if the rest of you
         agree, that as items come in that deal with motive, and I
         have seen, I suppose, 20 or 30 of them already in these
         various reports, those be pulled together by one of these
         men, maybe Mr. Rankin himself so that we could see that
         which would be so important to us.
            Chairman Warren:  In other words, to see what we are
         running down on the question of motive.
            Mr. Dulles:  Just on the question of motive I found a
         dozen or more statements of the various people as to why
         they thought he [Oswald] did it.
            Warren:  Yes.
            Mr. Dulles:  Or what his character was, what his aim, and
         so forth that go into motive and I think it would be very
         useful to pull that together, under one of these headings,
         not under a separate heading necessarily.
            Warren:  Well, I think that that would probably come
         under Mr. [Albert] Jenner, wouldn't that, Lee [Rankin],
         isn't he the one who is bringing together all the facts
         concerning the life of Oswald?
            Mr. Rankin:  Yes, yes.  We can get that done.  We will
         see that that is taken care of.
            Warren:  Yes.[20]

         The staff, working under the direction of Rankin, was likewise
      predisposed to the conclusion that Oswald was guilty.  Staff lawyer
      W. David Slawson wrote a memorandum dated January 27 concerning the
      "timing of rifle shots."  He suggested that:

            In figuring the timing of the rifle shots, we should take
         into account the distance travelled by the Presidential car
         between the first and third shots.  This tends to shorten
         the time slightly during which {Oswald} would have had to
         pull the trigger three times on his rifle.[21] (emphasis
         added)

      At this early point in the investigation, long before any of the
      relevant testimony had been adduced, Slawson was positive that
      Oswald "pulled the trigger three times on his rifle."
         Another staff lawyer, Arlen Specter, expressed the bias of the
      investigation in a memorandum, dated January 30, in which he
      offered suggestions for the questioning of Oswald's widow, Marina.
      Specter felt that certain questions "might provide some insight on
      whether Oswald learned of the motorcade route from newspapers."  He
      added that "perhaps [Oswald] was inspired, in part by President
      Kennedy's anti-Castro speech which was reported on November 19 on
      the front page of the Dallas Times Herald."[22]  The implication
      here is obvious that the President's speech "inspired" Oswald to
      commit the assassination.  Again, it must be emphasized that until
      Oswald's guilt was a proven fact, which it was {not} at the time
      these memoranda were composed, it was mere folly to investigate the
      factors that supposedly "inspired" Oswald.  Such fraudulent
      investigative efforts demonstrate that Oswald's guilt was taken for
      granted.
         Rankin had assigned teams of two staff lawyers each to evaluate
      the evidence according to the five divisions of his "Tentative
      Outline."  Working in Area II, "Lee Harvey Oswald as the Assassin
      of President Kennedy," were Joseph Ball as the senior lawyer and
      David Belin as the junior.[23]  On January 30, Belin wrote a very
      revealing memorandum to Rankin, concerning "Oswald's knowledge that
      Connally would be in the Presidential car and his intended
      target."[24]  This memorandum leaves no doubt that Belin was quite
      sure of Oswald's guilt {before} he began his assigned
      investigation.  He was concerned that Oswald might not have known
      that Governor Connally was to ride in the presidential limousine
      because this "bears on the motive of the assassination and also on
      the degree of marksmanship required, which in turn affects the
      determination that Oswald was the assassin and that it was not too
      difficult to hit the intended target two out of three times in this
      particular situation."  The alternatives, as stated by Belin, were
      as follows:

            In determining the accuracy of Oswald, we have three
         major possibilities:  Oswald was shooting at Connally and
         missed two of the three shots, two misses striking Kennedy;
         Oswald was shooting at both Kennedy and Connally and all
         three shots struck their intended targets;  Oswald was
         shooting only at Kennedy and the second bullet missed its
         intended target and hit Connally instead.[25]

      Belin could not have been more explicit:  Three shots were fired
      and Oswald, whatever his motive, fired them all.  Of course, at
      that point Belin could not possibly have {proved} that Oswald was
      the assassin.  He merely presumed it and worked on that basis.
         It is important to keep this January 30 Belin memorandum in mind
      when we consider the 233-page "BALL - BELIN REPORT #1" dated
      February 25, 1964, and submitted by the authors as a summation of
      all the evidence they had evaluated up to that point.  The
      "tentative" conclusion reached in this report is that "Lee Harvey
      Oswald is the assassin of President John F.  Kennedy."[26]
      However, Ball and Belin were careful to include here a new
      interpretation of their assigned area of work.  They wrote:

            We should also point out that the tentative memorandum of
         January 23 substantially differs from the original outline
         of our work in this area which had as its subject, "Lee
         Harvey Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy," and
         which examined the evidence from that standpoint.  At no
         time have we assumed that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin
         of President Kennedy.  Rather, our entire study has been
         based on an independent examination of all the evidence in
         an effort to determine who was the assassin of President
         Kennedy.[27]

         Although this new formulation was no doubt the proper one, the
      Warren Report makes it abundantly clear that Ball and Belin failed
      to follow the course outlined in their "Report #1."  As we have
      seen, the only context in which the evidence is presented in the
      Report is "Lee Harvey Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy,"
      even though that blatant description is not used (as it was in the
      secret working papers).  Furthermore, that Belin a month before
      could write so confidently that Oswald was the assassin completely
      refutes this belatedly professed intention to examine the evidence
      without preconceptions.  It would appear that in including this
      passage in "Report #1," Ball and Belin were more interested in
      leaving a record that they could later cite in their own defense
      than in conducting an honest, unbiased investigation.  Indeed,
      Belin has quoted this passage publicly to illustrate the
      impartiality of his work, while neglecting to mention his
      memorandum of January 30.[28]
         The Warren Report was not completed until late in September
      1964, with hearings and investigations extending into the period
      during which the Report was set in type.  Yet outlines for the
      final Report were drawn up as early as mid-{March}.  These outlines
      demonstrate that Oswald's guilt was a definite conclusion at the
      time that sworn testimony was first being taken by the Commission.
      The first outline was submitted to Rankin at his request by staff
      lawyer Alfred Goldberg on approximately March 14, according to
      notations on the outline.[29]  Under Goldberg's plan, Chapter Four
      of the Commission's report would be entitled "Lee Harvey Oswald as
      the Assassin."  Goldberg elaborated:

            This section should state the facts which lead to the
         conclusion that Oswald pulled the trigger and should
         indicate the elements in the case which have either not been
         proven or are based on doubtful testimony.  Each of the
         facts listed below should be reviewed in that light.[30]

         The "facts" enumberated [sic] by Goldberg are precarious.
      Indeed, as of March 14, 1964, no testimony had been adduced on
      almost all of the "facts" that Goldberg outlined as contributing to
      the "conclusion that Oswald pulled the trigger."  Goldberg felt
      that this chapter of the Report should identify Oswald's rifle "as
      the murder weapon."  Under this category he listed "Ballistics" and
      "Capability of Rifle."  Yet the first ballistics testimony was not
      heard by the Commission until March 31 (3H390ff.).  Another of
      Goldberg's categories is "Evidence of Oswald Carrying Weapon to
      Texas School Book Depository."  Here he does not specify which
      evidence he had in mind.  However, the expert testimony that
      {might} have supported the thesis that Oswald carried his rifle to
      work on the morning of the assassination was not adduced until
      April 2 and 3 (4H1ff.).  This pattern runs through several other
      factors that Goldberg felt established Oswald's guilt {before} they
      were scrutinized by the Commission or the staff.  To illustrate:
      "Testimony of eyewitnesses and employees on fifth floor"--this
      testimony was not taken until March 24, at which time the witnesses
      contradicted several of their previous statements to the federal
      authorities (3H161ff.);  "Medical testimony"--the autopsy surgeons
      testified on March 16 (2H347ff.), and medical/ballistics testimony
      concerning tests with Oswald's rifle was not taken until mid-May
      (5H74ff.);  "Eyewitness Identification of Oswald Shooting Rifle"--
      only one witness claimed to make such an identification, and he
      gave testimony on March 24 (3H140ff.) that was subsequently
      rejected by the Commission (R145-46).
         On March 26, staff lawyer Norman Redlich submitted another
      outline of the final Report to Rankin;  in almost all respects,
      Redlich's outline is identical with Goldberg's.  Chapter Four is
      entitled "Lee H. Oswald as the Assassin," with the notation that
      "this section should state the facts which lead to the conclusion
      that Oswald pulled the trigger. . . ."[31]  In general, Redlich is
      vaguer than Goldberg in his listing of those "facts" which should
      be presented to support the conclusion of Oswald's guilt.  However,
      he does specify what he considers to be "evidence of Oswald
      carrying weapon to building."  One factor, he wrote, is the "fake
      curtain rod story."  Yet, when Redlich submitted this outline, no
      investigation had been conducted into the veracity of the "curtain
      rod story."  The first information relevant to this is contained in
      an FBI report dated March 28 (24H460-61), and it was not until the
      last day in {August} that further inquiry was made (CE2640).
         The pattern is consistent.  The Commission outlined its work and
      concluded that Oswald was guilty before it did any investigation or
      took any testimony.  The Report was outlined, including a chapter
      concluding that Oswald was guilty, before the bulk of the
      Commission's work was completed.  Most notably, these conclusions
      were drafted {before} the staff arranged a series of tests that
      were to demonstrate whether the official theories about how the
      shooting occurred were physically possible.  A series of ballistics
      tests using Oswald's rifle, and an on-site reconstruction of the
      crime in Dealey Plaza were conducted in May;  the Report was
      outlined in March.  On April 27, Redlich wrote Rankin a memorandum
      "to explain the reasons why certain members of the staff feel that
      it is important" to reconstruct the events in Dealey Plaza as
      depicted in motion pictures of the assassination.  Redlich stated
      that the Report would "presumably" set forth a version of the
      assassination shots concluding "that the bullets were fired by one
      person located in the sixth floor southeast corner window of the
      TSBD building."  He then pointed out:

            As our investigation now stands, however, we have not
         shown that these events could possibly have occurred in the
         manner suggested above.  All we have is a reasonable
         hypothesis which appears to be supported by the medical
         testimony but which has not been checked out against the
         physical facts at the scene of the assassination.[32]

         Thus, Redlich admitted that the Commission did not know if the
      conclusions already outlined were even physically possible.  But
      his suggestion of on-site tests should not be taken to indicate his
      desire to establish the untainted truth, for he explicitly denied
      such a purpose in his memorandum.  Instead, he wrote:

            Our intention is not to establish the point with complete
         accuracy, but merely to substantiate the hypothesis which
         underlies the conclusions that Oswald was the sole
         assassin.[33]

      This is as unambiguous a statement as can be imagined.  The
      reconstruction was not to determine whether it was physically
      possible for Oswald to have committed the murder as described by
      the Commission;  it was "merely to substantitate" [sic] the
      preconceived conclusion "that Oswald was the sole assassin."
         On April 30, three days after Redlich composed the above-quoted
      memorandum, the Commission met in another secret executive session.
      Here Rankin added to the abundant proof that the Commission had
      already concluded that Oswald was guilty.  The following exchange
      was provoked when Dulles expressed his well-voiced preoccupation
      with biographical data relating to Oswald:

            Mr. Dulles:  Detailed biography of Lee Harvey Oswald--I
         think that ought to be somewhere.
            Mr. Rankin:  We thought it would be too voluminous to be
         in the body of the report.  We thought it would be helpful
         as supplementary material at the end.
            Mr. Dulles:  Well, I don't feel too strongly about where
         it should be.  This would be--I think some of the biography
         of Lee Harvey Oswald, though, ought to be in the main
         report.
            Mr. Rankin:  {Some of it will be necessary to tell the
         story and to show why it is reasonable to assume that he did
         what the Commission concludes that he did do}.[34] (emphasis
         added)

         As late as the middle of May, long after the Commission and the
      staff had decided, in advance of analyzing the evidence, that
      Oswald was guilty, Commission member McCloy expressed his feeling
      that the conclusion as to Oswald's guilt was not being pursued with
      enough vigor by the staff.  McCloy was not interested in a fair and
      objective report.  This story was related by David Belin in his
      memorandum of May 15, which described his trip to Dallas with
      certain Commission members, McCloy included.  One night in Dallas,
      Belin persuaded McCloy to read "Ball-Belin Report # 1," which by
      then was almost three months old.  Belin recounts McCloy's
      reactions:

            He seemed to misunderstand the basic purpose of the
         report, for he suggested that we did not point up enough
         arguments to show why Oswald was the assassin. . . .
         Commissioner McCloy did state that in the final report he
         thought that we should be rather complete in developing
         reasons and affirmative statements why Oswald was the
         assassin--he did not believe that it should just merely be a
         factual restatement of what we had found.[35]

         As quoted at the opening of this chapter, the Warren Report
      asserted that the Commission functioned not "as a prosecutor
      determined to prove a case, but as a fact finding agency committed
      to the ascertainment of the truth."  This statement is clearly a
      misrepresentation of the Commission's real position, as expressed
      in private by McCloy when he told Belin that he wanted a report
      that argued a prosecution case, and not simply "a factual
      restatement."
         The Dallas Police and the FBI both announced their "conclusion"
      before it could have been adequately substantiated by facts and, in
      so doing, almost irrevocably prejudiced the American public against
      Oswald and thwarted an honest and unbiased investigation.  The
      Commission operated under a facade of impartiality.  Yet it
      examined the evidence--and subsequently presented it--on the
      premise that Oswald was guilty, a premise openly stated in secret
      staff memoranda and reinforced when the members met in secret
      sessions.  Now, as the curtain of secrecy that once sheltered the
      working papers of the investigation is lifted, the ugly and
      improper presumption of guilt becomes obvious.  Wesley Liebeler
      expressed the prejudice of the entire "investigation" when he
      argued to Rankin in a once-secret memorandum that " . . . the best
      evidence that Oswald could fire as fast as he did and hit the
      target is the fact that he did so."[36]

      PART II:


      THE MEDICAL/BALLISTICS EVIDENCE

      3


      Suppressed Spectrography




      In the final analysis, the Warren Commission had three pieces of
      tangible evidence that linked Lee Harvey Oswald to the
      assassination of President Kennedy:  (1) A rifle purchased by
      Oswald and three empty cartridge cases fired in that rifle were
      discovered on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository,
      (2) a nearly whole bullet that had been fired from Oswald's rifle
      was found on a stretcher at Parkland Hospital, and (3) two
      fragments of a bullet or bullets that had been fired from Oswald's
      rifle were found on the front seat of the presidential limousine.
         Yet, there is nothing in this evidence itself to prove either
      that Oswald's rifle was used in the shooting or, if it was, that
      Oswald fired it.  The whole fault in the Commission's case relating
      the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle to the shooting is this:  bullets
      identifiable with that rifle were found {outside} of the victims'
      bodies.  Pieces of metal not traceable to any rifle were found
      {inside} the bodies.  The Report merely assumes the legitimacy of
      the specimens found externally and works on the assumption that
      these bullets and fragments had once been {inside} the bodies, and
      thus were involved in the shooting.
         Obviously, bullets found outside the bodies are entirely
      circumstantial evidence, for although they may be conclusively
      linked with a particular weapon, their location of discovery does
      not link them with a particular victim.  No matter how close to the
      victims or to the scene of the crime these bullets were found, as
      long as they were not {in} the actual bodies when discovered, proof
      is lacking that they were ever in the bodies at all.  If Commission
      Exhibit 399, the nearly whole bullet found on a stretcher at
      Parkland, had been removed from Governor Connally's body, it could
      be asserted that it had indeed produced his wounds.  Likewise, if
      the identifiable bullet fragments found on the front seat of the
      limousine had instead been located in President Kennedy's head
      wound, we would have the proof linking Oswald's rifle to the fatal
      shot.
         In the case of the assassination, there was an easy and
      conclusive way to determine whether the bullet specimens found
      {outside} the bodies had ever been {inside} the victims, thus
      providing either the proof or the disproof of the notion that
      Oswald's rifle was used in the shooting.  This conclusive evidence
      is the spectrographic comparison made between the metallic
      compositions of the projectiles found outside of the victims and
      the bits of metal removed from the wounds themselves.
         Spectrography is an exact science.  In spectrographic analysis,
      a test substance is irradiated so that all of the elements
      composing it emit a distinct spectrum.  These spectra are recorded
      on film and analyzed both qualitatively (to determine exactly which
      elements compose the substance in question) and quantitatively (to
      determine the exact percentage of each element present).  Through
      such analysis, two substances may be compared in extremely fine
      detail, down to the percentages of even their most minor
      constituents.[1]
         Comparative chemical analysis such as spectrography has long
      been a vital tool in crime solving.  The following are actual cases
      that illustrate the value of such comparison:

          1.  A deformed slug with some white metal adhering to it
              was found at the scene where a man had been shot, but
              not wounded.  The white metal was first suspected to be
              nickel, which would have indicated a nickel-coated
              bullet, but was subsequently tested and found to be
              silver from a cigarette case that had been penetrated.
              The slugs in the cartridges taken from the suspect in
              the attack were analyzed and found to differ in
              composition from the projectile used in the shooting;
              the suspect thus escaped conviction.

          2.  In another case, a man escaped conviction because of
              dissimilarities in composition found upon comparative
              analysis of the bullet removed from the wounded man and
              bullets from cartridges seized in the suspect's house.
              The former contained a trace of antimony and no tin and
              the latter contained a comparatively large amount of
              tin.

          3.  A night watchman shot at some unidentified persons
              fleeing the scene of a robbery, but all escaped.  Blood
              found at the scene the next morning indicated that one
              of the persons had been wounded and subsequently a man
              was arrested with a bullet wound in his leg for which
              he could provide no plausible explanation.  Analysis
              demonstrated that lead fragments removed from the wound
              did not agree in composition with the slugs in the
              watchman's cartridges and the man was released.  The
              impurities present in the lead were the same in each
              case, consisting chiefly of antimony, but the fragments
              from the wound contained much less antimony than the
              watchman's slugs.[2]

         The identifiable bullets and fragments found {outside} the
      victims' bodies are the suspect specimens in the presidential
      assassination.  The tiny pieces of metal found {inside} the bodies
      are, in effect, the control specimens.  All of the specimens--
      including those removed from the President and the Governor--were
      subjected to spectrographic analysis.  The results of these
      analyses hold the conclusive answer to the problem that was the
      central issue in the question of Oswald's guilt:  Did the bullets
      from Oswald's rifle produce the wounds of the victims?
         The spectrographic analyses could solve this central problem
      through minute qualitative and quantitative comparison.  If a
      fragment from a body was not {identical} in composition with a
      suspect bullet, that bullet could not have entered the body and
      left the fragment in question.  The requirements for "identical"
      composition are stringent;  if the exact elements are not present
      in the exact percentages from one sample to another, there is no
      match and the samples must have originated from two different
      sources.  If a fragment is found to be identical in composition
      with a suspect bullet, it is possible that the bullet deposited the
      fragment in the body.  However, before this can be conclusively
      proven, it must be demonstrated that other bullets manufactured
      from the same batch of metal were not employed in the crime.[3]
      Some of the major comparisons that should have been made in the
      case of the President's death are these:

          1.  The Commission apparently believed that the two large
              bullet fragments (one containing part of a lead core)
              found on the front seat of the car and traceable to
              Oswald's rifle were responsible for the head wounds.
              Two pieces of lead were recovered from the President's
              head.  The head fragments could have been compared to
              the car fragment containing lead.  Had the slightest
              difference in composition been found, the car fragments
              could not have caused the head wounds.

          2.  The Commission believed that the two car fragments were
              part of the same bullet.  Spectrographic comparison
              might have determined this.

          3.  Copper traces were found on the bullet holes in the
              back of the President's coat and shirt.  Since the
              Commission believed that bullet 399 penetrated the
              President's neck, the copper residues on the clothing
              could have been compared with the copper jacket of 399
              for a conclusive answer.  Any dissimilarity between the
              two copper samples would rule out 399.

          4.  The Commission believed that 399 wounded Governor
              Connally.  Fragments of lead were removed from the
              Governor's wrist.  These could have been compared with
              the lead core of 399.  Again, any dissimilarity would
              conclusively disassociate 399 from Connally's wounds.
              An identical match might support the Commission's
              belief.

          5.  The lead from the Governor's wrist could have been
              compared with the lead from one of the identifiable car
              fragments to determine whether this might have caused
              Connally's wounds in the event that 399 did not.  This
              could have associated "Oswald's" rifle with the wounds
              even if 399 had been proven "illegitimate."

          6.  The lead residue found on the crack in the windshield
              of the car could have been compared with fragments from
              the two bodies plus fragments from the car in an effort
              to determine which shot caused the windshield damage.

          7.  As a control, the lead and copper composition of 399
              could have been compared to that of the identifiable
              car fragments to determine whether all were made from
              the same batches of metal.

         The government had in its possession the conclusive proof or
      disproof of its theories.  It is not presumptuous to assume that,
      had the spectrographic analyses provided the incontrovertible proof
      of the validity of the Warren Report's central conclusions, they
      would have been employed in the Report, eliminating virtually all
      of the controversy and doubt that have raged over the official
      assertions.
         But the complete results of the spectrographic analyses were
      never reported to the Commission;  there is no indication that the
      Commission ever requested or desired them;  they are not in the
      printed exhibits or the Commission's unpublished files;  no expert
      testimony relevant to them was ever adduced;  and to this day, the
      Department of Justice is withholding the complete results from
      researchers.
         On November 23, 1963, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover sent a report
      to Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry summarizing the results of FBI
      laboratory examinations, including spectrographic analysis (see
      24H262-64).  On the matter of composition, Hoover said only that
      the jackets of the found specimens were "copper alloy" and the
      cores and other pieces, "lead."  The element mixed with the copper
      to form the "alloy" is not even mentioned.  It is quite unlikely
      that the other specimens were composed solely of "lead," for the
      lead employed in practically all modern bullets is mixed with small
      quantities of antimony, bismuth, and arsenic.[4]  The only
      spectrographic comparison mentioned in this report is meaningless:

            The lead metal of [exhibits] Q4 and Q5 [fragments from
         the President's head], Q9 [fragment(s) from the Governor's
         wrist], Q14 [three pieces of lead found under the left jump
         seat in the limousine] and Q15 [scraping from the windshield
         crack] is similar to the lead of the core of the bullet
         fragment, Q2 [found on the front seat of the car].

      That two samples are "similar" in composition is without meaning in
      terms of the precise data yielded through spectrographic analysis.
      The crucial determination, "identical" or "not identical," is
      consistently avoided.  Also avoided is the essential comparison
      between the "stretcher bullet," 399, and the metal fragments
      removed from the Governor's wrist.
         The Commission sought virtually no testimony relevant to the
      spectrographic analysis.  When it did seek this testimony, it asked
      the wrong questions of the wrong people.  FBI ballistics expert
      Robert Frazier gave testimony about these tests on May 13, 1964.
      At this time, he told the Commission and Arlen Specter, his
      interrogator, that the spectrographics examinations were performed
      by a spectrographer, John F. Gallager (5H67, 69).  Frazier,
      accepted by the Commission only as a "qualified witness on
      firearms" (3H392), was not a spectrographic expert.  His field was
      ballistics and firearms identification, and while he might have
      supplemented his findings with those from other fields, he was not
      qualified in spectrography, which entails expertise in physics and
      chemistry.  Gallagher, the expert, could well be called the
      Commission's most-avoided witness.  His testimony, the {last} taken
      in the entire investigation, was given in a deposition attended by
      a stenographer and a staff member the week before the Warren Report
      was submitted to President Johnson.  At this time, he was not asked
      a single question relating to the spectrographic analyses.[5] (See
      15H746ff.)
         Neither Specter nor the Commission members can deny having known
      that Frazier was not the man qualified to testify about
      spectrographic analysis;  Frazier stated this in his testimony:

            Mr. Specter:  Was it your job to analyze all of the
         bullets or bullet fragments which were found in the
         President's car?
            Mr. Frazier:  Yes;  it was, {except for the
         spectrographic analysis of the composition}.  (5H68;
         emphasis added)

      Frazier added, "I don't know actually whether I am expected to give
      the results of (the spectrographer's) analysis or not" (5H59).  If
      this statement fails to make it clear that Frazier was not prepared
      to testify about the results of the spectrographic analyses, an
      earlier statement by him leaves no doubt:  "[The spectrographic]
      examination was performed by a spectrographer, John F. Gallagher,
      and I do not have the results of his examination here" (5H67).  If
      Frazier did not have the actual report of the results of the tests
      with him when he appeared before the Commission, there was
      obviously no way of vouching for the accuracy of the findings to
      which he testified, whether he was qualified as an expert in
      spectrography or not.  Also, Frazier's knowledge of the
      spectrographic analysis was merely secondhand;  he was aware of the
      results of these tests because the spectrographer "submitted his
      report to me" (5H69).  Thus, Frazier played no role in conducting
      this analysis.  His only "qualification" for giving testimony about
      the spectrographic analyses was that he had read a report about
      them.  Because this report is not part of the public records, we
      have no way of determining whether Frazier accurately related the
      results of the analyses, or whether the report upon which he based
      his testimony was competent, complete, or satisfactory.  In short,
      we are asked to take Frazier on his word when (1) he knew of these
      tests only secondhand, (2) he did not have the actual results with
      him when he testified about them, and (3) he had no expertise in
      spectrography.  On this basis alone, Frazier's testimony concerning
      the tests is not worthy of credence.
         However, if we examine exactly what Frazier specified as the
      results of the spectrographic analyses, it becomes apparent that
      his testimony, if true, is meaningless and incomplete.  Frazier
      spoke of essentially the same comparisons that Hoover did in his
      letter to police chief Curry, repeating Hoovers meaningless
      designation that the ballistic specimens compared were "found to be
      similar in metallic composition" (5H67, 69, 73-74).  When the
      {exact} composition had been determined to a minute degree and
      could be compared for conclusive and meaningful answers, there was
      no legitimate reason to accept this testimony about mere
      "similarities" in composition.  Furthermore, Frazier offered his
      opinion that the spectrographic analyses were inconclusive in
      determining the origin of certain of the ballistics specimens
      (5H67, 69, 73-74).  However, because Frazier was not a
      spectrographic expert and because the actual report of these tests
      is not available, his interpretation of the test results is
      worthless.  Even at that, Frazier and his Commission interrogator,
      Arlen Specter, avoided mention of those comparisons affecting the
      legitimacy of bullet 399--namely, the copper from the President's
      clothing and the lead from Governor Connally's wrist as compared
      with the copper and lead of 399.
         Frazier was cross-examined at the New Orleans conspiracy trial
      of Clay Shaw.  Here he was pressed further on the spectrographic
      analysis.  When asked about any "similarity" in the compositions of
      the various ballistic specimens he replied, "They all had the same
      metallic composition as far as the lead core or lead portions of
      these objects is concerned."[6]
         This response prompts two inferences.  First, Frazier
      specifically excluded as being the "same in metallic composition"
      the {copper} portions of the specimens.  If this omission was
      necessitated by the fact that the copper of the recovered specimens
      did not match in composition, a significant part of the Warren
      Report is disproved.  Second, Frazier's description of the lead as
      being the "same" in composition is ambiguous.  Did he mean that the
      {elements} of the composition or the {percentages} of the elements
      were the "same"?  In the former case, his testimony would again be
      meaningless, for {what} is contained in the metal is not so
      important as {how much} is contained.  If the percentages were the
      same, the Report could be confirmed.
         Further questioning by Attorney Oser cleared up this ambiguity.

            Mr. Oser:  Am I correct in saying there is a similarity
         in metallic composition or they are identical?
            Mr. Frazier:  It was identical as far as the metallic
         {elements} are concerned.[7] (emphasis added)

      Here Frazier leaves no doubt that the individual {elements} in the
      various lead samples were identical.  What he avoids saying is that
      the percentages of those elements were identical throughout.  This
      is the crucial point.  If anything, Frazier's specification that
      the {elements} were identical (when questioned about the
      {composition}) leads to the inference that the percentages of those
      elements were not identical, hence the recovered specimens could
      {not} be related and the Warren Report is necessarily invalid.
         The Commission's failure to obtain the complete spectrographic
      analyses and to adduce meaningful expert testimony on them can be
      viewed only with suspicion.  Here was the absolute proof or
      disproof of the official theories.  If truth was the Commission's
      objective, there can be no explanation for the exclusion of these
      tests from the record.  If the Commission was right in its
      "solution" of the assassination, for what reason could it
      conceivably have omitted the {proof} of its validity?  One is
      reasonably led to believe that the spectrographic analyses proved
      the opposite of what the Commission asserted.
         If the Commission's failure to produce the spectrographic
      analyses was no more than a glaring oversight, the remedy is indeed
      a simple one.  The government need only release these tests to the
      public.  They cannot contain the gore that makes publication of the
      President's autopsy pictures a matter of questionable taste.  They
      cannot be injurious to living persons as other classified reports
      might be.  They cannot threaten our national defense.  They are
      merely a collection of highly scientific data that could support or
      destroy the entire official solution to the assassination.
         The government has to this day kept them squelched.
         Harold Weisberg, the first researcher to recognize the
      significance of the spectrographic tests and their omission from
      the record, has fought and continues to fight for access to the
      report detailing these tests.  In 1967, Weisberg wrote as follows
      of his efforts to obtain the tests:

            On October 31, 1966, then Acting Attorney General Clark
         ordered that everything considered by the Commission and in
         the possession of the government be placed in the National
         Archives.  I had written [J. Edgar] Hoover five months
         earlier, on May 23, 1966, asking for access to the
         spectrographic analysis of the bullet allegedly used in the
         assassination and the various bullet fragments, clearly the
         most basic evidence, but not in the printed evidence.  He
         has not yet answered that letter.  Since issuance of the
         Attorney General's order, I have on a number of occasions
         requested this evidence of the Archives.  Hoover, as of
         March 1967, had not turned it over.  Once, in my presence,
         one of his agents deceived the Archives by falsely reporting
         this analysis was in an FBI file that was accessible.  Since
         then, silence, but no spectrographic analysis.[8]

         Weisberg's efforts have continued.  In 1970, he made available
      to me all of his government correspondence.  I saw, over the
      signatures of then Attorney General John Mitchell and Deputy
      Attorney General Richard Kleindienst, the government's constant
      refusal to release the spectrographic analyses.[9]  Having
      exhausted his administrative remedies, Weisberg took the Justice
      Department to court, suing for release under provisions of the
      "Freedom of Information" law.  The U.S. District Court for the
      District of Columbia ruled against Weisberg in this case, Civil
      Action No. 712-70.  Weisberg and his attorney appealed this
      decision, and the appeal, brief No. 71-1026, is currently before
      the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
         Without the spectrographic analyses, there is {no} evidence to
      associate Oswald's rifle with the wounds suffered by President
      Kennedy and Governor Connally.  Nothing was found in the body of
      either victim that would suggest a connection between that specific
      Mannlicher-Carcano and the wounds.  The spectrographic tests might
      establish such a connection;  they might also conclusively
      {dissociate} that rifle from the wounds.  However, omission of the
      exact spectrographic results from the Commission's evidence and the
      subsequent refusal of the government to release the
      spectrographer's findings do not leave one at all confident that
      these tests support the official solution to the assassination.

      The Governor's Wounds and the Validity of the Essential Conclusions

      In the case of Governor Connally, it is not possible to determine
      the type of ammunition that produced his wounds.  Three bones in
      his body were struck by a bullet, two of them seriously broken and
      fractured, and flecks of metal were observed in, and in one case
      removed from, his injuries.  The presence of these metallic
      fragments in the Governor's wounds, however, does not specifically
      indicate that he was struck by a type of sporting ammunition,
      because the force with which the bone tissue was struck was
      sufficient for military ammunition to have deposited the fragments
      observed.  It is the Warren Commission's belief that the Governor's
      wounds were caused by the almost pristine bullet, CE 399, fired
      from Oswald's rifle (R95).  Therefore, in this chapter I will deal
      not with the general question of the type of ammunition, but with a
      specific bullet, CE 399.  The question to be answered is this:  Did
      bullet 399 produce the wounds sustained by Governor Connally?
         A bullet entered the back of the Governor's chest to the left of
      his right armpit.  This bullet struck the fifth rib and shattered
      it, actually stripping away about 10 cm. of bone starting
      immediately below the armpit (4H105;  6H86).  The right lung was
      severely lacerated (6H88).  The bullet exited from the anterior
      chest, causing a large sucking wound about 5 cm. in diameter just
      below the right nipple (6H85).  There was an atypical entrance
      wound on the dorsal (back of the hand) side of the Governor's wrist
      and an atypical exit wound on the volar (palm) side (6H07;  R93).
      The radius (wrist bone) had been broken into about seven or eight
      pieces from the passage of the bullet (4H120).  There was a 1 cm.
      puncture wound located on the Governor's left thigh some five to
      six inches above the knee (R93).  X rays revealed a small metallic
      fragment embedded in the left thigh bone, the femur (6H106).  This
      fragment was not surgically removed and still remains in Mr.
      Connally's femur.
         It is probable that one bullet caused all of Connally's
      injuries.  In support of this hypothesis, the Report paraphrases
      the Parkland doctors as follows:

            In their testimony, the three doctors who attended
         Governor Connally expressed independently their opinion that
         a single bullet had passed through his chest, tumbled
         through his wrist with very little exit velocity, leaving
         small metallic fragments from the rear portion of the
         bullet;  punctured his left thigh after the bullet had lost
         virtually all of its velocity;  and had fallen out of the
         thigh wound. (R95)

      A footnote to this statement cites portions of the doctors'
      depositions taken in Dallas on March 23, before two of them were
      brought to Washington to testify for the Commission a month later.
      At this time, they had not seen bullet 399 and spoke on a strictly
      hypothetical basis.
         Dr. Tom Shires, who was involved in the Governor's medical
      treatment, explained that, from the discussion among Connally's
      surgeons, "everyone was under the impression this was one missile-
      -through and through the chest, through and through the arm and the
      thigh."  When asked if any of the doctors had dissented from this
      consensus he replied, "Not that I remember" (6H110).
         Dr. Charles Gregory, who attended to the Governor's wrist wound,
      best explained the reasoning behind the theory that one bullet
      caused Connally's wounds:

            Mr. Specter:  Would you consider it possible, in your
         professional opinion, for the same bullet to have inflicted
         all of the wounds which you have described on Governor
         Connally?
            Dr. Gregory:  Yes;  I believe it is very possible, for a
         number of reasons.  One of these--is the apparent loss of
         energy manifested at each of the various body surfaces,
         which I transected, the greatest energy being at the point
         of entry on the posterior aspect of the chest and of the
         fifth rib, where considerable destruction was done and the
         least destruction having been done in the medial aspect of
         the thigh where the bullet apparently expended itself.
             . . . We know that high velocity bullets striking bone
         have a strong tendency to shatter bones and the degree to
         which the fifth rib was shattered was considerably in excess
         of the amount of shattering which occurred in the radius--
         the forearm.
             . . . I think that the missile was continually losing
         velocity with each set of tissues which it encountered and
         transected, and the amount of damage done is progressively
         less from first entrance to the thorax to the last entrance
         in the thigh. (6H101-2)

            The Report is entirely misleading, however, when it asserts
      that the doctors felt that the wrist fragments were left "from the
      rear portion of the bullet" and that this {bullet} subsequently
      punctured the thigh.  In their original testimonies, the doctors
      did not postulate from what part of the bullet the fragments had
      come.  The intent of the Report is obvious, when we consider that
      the only possible surface from which CE 399 could have lost
      fragments is its rear, or base, where the lead core was naturally
      exposed.  The thinking of the doctors, however, tended to rule out
      the possibility of CE 399's having gone into the wrist at all,
      because they felt that this wound was the result of an irregular or
      fragmented missile (6H90-91, 98-99, 102).  Dr. Robert Shaw, who
      conducted the operation on the Governor's chest, was puzzled as to
      how the wrist wounds could have appeared as they did if a whole
      bullet had caused them (6H91).
         According to Dr. Shaw, it is not exactly correct to assert that
      a whole bullet entered the thigh.  In the portion of his original
      testimony cited by the Report, Dr.  Shaw explained the theory of
      one bullet's causing all the Governor's wounds in this way:  "I
      have always felt that the wounds of Governor Connally could be
      explained by the passage of one missile through his chest, striking
      his wrist and {a fragment of it} going on into his left thigh"
      (6H91;  emphasis added).
         What the Report does not reflect is the substantial change in
      Drs. Shaw's and Gregory's opinions when shown the bullet that
      allegedly produced the Governor's wounds.  The first indication of
      varied opinions came through this exchange between Dr. Shaw and
      Commissioners Cooper, Dulles, and McCloy.  Dr.  Shaw had been asked
      about the possibility that one bullet had caused the Governor's
      wounds:

            Dr. Shaw:  . . . this is still a possibility.  But I
         don't feel that it is the only possibility.
            Sen. Cooper:  Why do you say you don't think it is the
         only possibility?  What causes you {now} to say that it is
         the location--
            Dr. Shaw:  This is again the testimony that I believe Dr.
         Gregory will be giving, too.  It is a matter of whether the
         wrist wound could be caused by the same bullet, and we felt
         that it could but {but we had not seen the bullets until
         today,} and we still do not know which bullet actually
         inflicted the wound on Governor Connally.
            Mr. Dulles:  Or whether it was one or two rounds?
            Dr. Shaw:  Yes.
            Mr. Dulles:  Or two bullets?
            Dr. Shaw:  Yes;  or three.


            Mr. McCloy:  You have no firm opinion that all these
         three wounds were caused by one bullet?
            Dr. Shaw:  I have no firm opinion. . . .  Asking me now
         if it was true.  {If you had asked me a month ago I would
         have} [had].
            Mr. McCloy:  Could they have been caused by one bullet,
         in your opinion?
            Dr. Shaw:  They could.
            Mr. McCloy:  I gather that what the witness is saying is
         that it is possible that they might have been caused by one
         bullet.  But that he has no firm opinion {now} that they
         were.
            Mr. Dulles:  As I understand it too.  Is our
         understanding correct?
            Dr. Shaw:  That is correct. (4H109;  emphasis added)

         It might be regarded as highly culpable that Commissioners
      Dulles and McCloy, who professed such a clear understanding of Dr.
      Shaw's position, signed a report stating the opposite of what Dr.
      Shaw had testified to, with a footnote referring to prior
      statements withdrawn by Shaw in their presence.  Dr. Shaw's
      testimony is explicit that, prior to seeing the bullet in evidence,
      he felt that all the Governor's wounds were caused by one bullet;
      when shown the bullet, CE 399, which allegedly did this damage, he
      retracted his original opinion.  What was it about this bullet that
      caused such a change of judgment?
         Under questioning by Arlen Specter, Dr. Shaw summed up the
      indications that CE 399 did not produce the Governor's wounds.  He
      had first been asked to comment on the possibility of a bullet's
      having caused the wounds:

            Mr. Specter:  When you started to comment about it not
         being possible, was that in reference to the existing mass
         and shape of bullet 399?
            Dr. Shaw:  I thought you were referring directly to the
         bullet shown as Exhibit 399.
            Mr. Specter:  What is your opinion as to whether bullet
         399 could have inflicted all the wounds on the Governor
         then, without respect at this point to the wound of the
         President's neck?
            Dr. Shaw:  I feel that there would be some difficulty in
         explaining all of the wounds as being inflicted by bullet
         Exhibit 399 without causing more in the way of loss of
         substance to the bullet or deformation of the bullet.
         (4H114)

         CE 399 is a virtually undistorted, intact bullet.  Its weight is
      approximately two grains below the average weight of an unfired
      bullet of that type.  As was mentioned in the previous chapter,
      none of the copper jacket of 399 is missing.  The nose and sides of
      this bullet--as shown in photographs and as I saw in a personal
      examination--are without gross deformity.  The base of 399 has been
      slightly squeezed so that, in contrast to its rounded shaft, the
      tail end is slightly elliptical in shape.  A small amount of lead,
      which apparently has flowed from the open base, creates a slight
      irregularity of the base.
         Given the almost pristine condition of CE 399, it is
      understandable that Drs. Shaw and Gregory were puzzled at the
      inference that this bullet had caused the Governor's wounds.
      Before having seen 399, they imagined the bullet that penetrated
      Connally as being irregular or distorted, the natural consequence
      of powerful impacts with two substantial bones.  Dr. Shaw did not
      think the bullet could even have remained intact (6H91).  On the
      basis of the nature of the wrist wound, Dr. Gregory thought that
      "the missile that struck it could be virtually intact, insofar as
      mass was concerned, but probably was {distorted}" (6H99).
         According to Dr. Gregory, the wrist wound showed characteristics
      of suffering the impact of an {irregular} missile (6H98, 102).  In
      his testimony before the Commission, Dr. Gregory expounded on the
      nature of this "irregular" missile:

            Dr. Gregory:  The wound of entrance (on the wrist) is
         characteristic in my view of an irregular missile in this
         case, an irregular missile which has tipped itself off as
         being irregular by the nature of itself.
            Mr. Dulles:  What do you mean by irregular?
            Dr. Gregory:  I mean one that has been distorted.  It is
         in some way angular, it has sharp edges or something of this
         sort.  It is not rounded or pointed in the fashion of an
         ordinary missile. (4H124)

         Obviously, the condition of the bullet that produced the wrist
      wound, as described by Dr. Gregory, does not match that of bullet
      399, which is not "distorted" or "irregular."  There is only one
      surface on CE 399 that is the least bit "irregular," the base end
      where the lead core is naturally exposed.  When Arlen Specter asked
      Dr. Gregory about a possible correlation between CE 399 and the
      wrist wound, the latter responded:

         the only . . . deformity which I can find is at the base of
         the missile. . . .  The only way that this missile could
         have produced this wound, in my view, was to have entered
         the wrist backward. . . .  That is the only possible
         explanation I could offer to correlate this missile with
         this particular wound. (4H121)

      Dr. Gregory admitted, in response to a hypothetical question from
      Counsel Specter, that the slight irregularity in the base of CE 399
      "could have" been sufficient to produce the lacerated wounds
      observed on the Governor's wrist (4H122).
         Yet, Dr. Gregory's only correlation of CE 399 to the wrist wound
      is not applicable to the circumstances of the shooting.  Dr.
      Gregory examined 399 in its spent state, long after it had been
      fired and incurred its slight amount of damage.  He related the
      bullet in {this} state to a bullet in flight that had not suffered
      the full extent of its damage.  The irregularity of 399's base
      would have occurred {after} it hit the wrist, as the Commission
      postulates.  Certainly a base-first strike on the radius would not
      have left the base in the same condition as it was {prior} to
      impact.  Dr. Gregory's answer to Specter's hypothetical question
      could not apply to the actual shooting.
         Specter knew independently from wound ballistics experts that
      the condition of CE 399 was not at all consistent with having
      struck a wrist.  Two conferences that Specter attended were held
      during the week prior to Dr. Gregory's Commission testimony.  The
      consensus of the first meeting was, in part, that "the bullet
      recovered from the Governor's stretcher does not appear to have
      penetrated a wrist."[1]  The expert opinion was more explicit at
      the next meeting, held the day of the Shaw-Gregory testimony and
      attended by those doctors, the wound ballistics experts, Specter,
      McCloy, and others.  A memorandum of this conference reports that

         in a discussion after the conference Drs. Light and Dolce
         (two wound ballistics experts from Edgewood Arsenal)
         expressed themselves as being very strongly of the opinion
         that Connally had been hit by two different bullets,
         principally on the ground that the bullet recovered from
         Connally's stretcher could not have broken his radius
         without having suffered more distortion.  Dr. Olivier
         (another wound ballistics expert) withheld a conclusion
         until he has had the opportunity to make tests on animal
         tissue and bone with the actual rifle.[2]

      Fig. 4.  CE 399 (far left) is beautifully preserved as compared to
      similar bullets fired from the Carcano:  (from left to right) CE
      853, fired through a goat's chest, CE 857 (in two pieces), fired
      into a human skull, and CE 856, fired into a human wrist.  Not one
      of the three, each of which did less damage than the Commission
      attributes to 399, emerged as undistorted as 399.  It is
      preposterous to assume that 399 could have struck so many
      obstructions and remained so undamaged.  (This photograph was taken
      for Harold Weisberg by the National Archives.)


         Dr. Olivier's tests, despite their shortcomings, demonstrated a
      very common ballistics principle--that a bullet striking bone will
      usually suffer some form of distortion.
         As is apparent from Figure 4, none of Dr. Olivier's test bullets
      admitted into evidence matched 399, since all were grossly deformed
      by extreme flattening, indenting, or separation of jacket from core
      (see also 17H849-51).
         Although Dr. Olivier's tests included shots through ten cadaver
      wrists, only one of the bullets recovered from this series was
      admitted into evidence, CE 856 (see Fig. 4).  The other bullets are
      not in the National Archives, and until recently no researchers had
      seen them.  On March 27, 1973, the Archives declassified a once-
      "Confidential" report written in March 1965 by Dr. Olivier and his
      associate, Dr. Arthur J. Dziemian.  This report is entitled "Wound
      Ballistics of 6.5-MM Mannlicher-Carcano Ammunition," and represents
      the final report of the research conducted for the Commission at
      Edgewood Arsenal.  This report includes photographs of four of the
      test bullets fired through human wrists, published here for the
      first time ever (Fig. 5).  The bullet marked "B" in Figure 5 is
      apparently CE 856.  However, the other three bullets, which
      produced damage similar to that suffered by Governor Connally's
      wrist, are even more mutilated than the one bullet that was
      preserved for the record.  These newly released photographs
      graphically reveal the degree of mutilation that might be found on
      Mannlicher-Carcano bullets that had struck human wrists, and make
      even more preposterous the Commission's assertion that near-
      pristine 399 penetrated Connally's wrist. {goes below: .ll 75}

      Fig. 5.  This photograph was considered "Confidential" by the
      government and withheld from researchers for eight years.  It
      depicts "6.5-MM Mannlicher-Carcano Bullets Recovered after being
      Fired Through Distal Ends of Radii of Cadaver Wrists."


         The obvious conclusion dictated by the nature of the Governor's
      wounds is that CE 399 could not have caused them.  This is contrary
      to the Report's assertion that "all the evidence indicated that the
      bullet found on the Governor's stretcher could have caused all his
      wounds" (R95).  The substantiating argument of the Report is that
      the total weight of the bullet fragments in the Governor's body
      does not exceed the weight lost by 399.  This argument is
      nonsensical, for it ignores the thoroughly nonstatistical nature of
      ballistics and the expected consequences of bullets striking bone;
      such a line of reasoning attempts to replace imprecision with
      pseudo-exactness and inapplicable mathematics.
         It is therefore, in light of the well-preserved state of that
      bullet, preposterous to postulate that CE 399 caused Governor
      Connally's wounds.  Drs. Shaw and Gregory, barraged by the official
      contention that 399 was discovered on the Governor's stretcher and
      thus must have caused his wounds, were reserved in expressing
      themselves on the unlikelihood of such a proposition.  Other
      experts have been more free in voicing their opinions.  I have yet
      to find one expert who will concede the likelihood of an occurrence
      such as the Commission assumes.  When I spoke with ballistics
      expert Charles Dickey at Frankford Arsenal, he cautioned me that he
      could not speak out directly against the validity of the
      government's beliefs relating to the assassination.  Even he found
      it hard to accept that 399 caused the Governor's wounds.[3]  Among
      the many forensic pathologists who have scoffed at this theory are
      William Enos,[4] Halpert Fillinger,[5] Milton Helpern,[6] John
      Nichols,[7] and Cyril Wecht.[8]
         The absence of gross deformity in bullet 399 contradicts the
      career of massive bone-smashing attributed to it.  However, as I
      learned from Dr. Fillinger and as Harold Weisberg pointed out
      several years ago in a copyrighted study of the medical evidence,
      the most crucial aspect of 399's state is its absence of
      significant distortion detectable through microscopic
      examination.[9]
         The barrels of modern firearms are "rifled," that is, several
      spiral grooves are cut into the barrel from end to end.  As the
      bullet is propelled through the barrel, these spiral grooves and
      lands (the raised portions of the barrel between the grooves) set
      the bullet spinning around its axis, giving it rotational as well
      as forward movement, thus increasing its stability in flight.  The
      lands and grooves consequently etch a pattern of very fine striated
      lines along the sides of the bullet, which will vary from one
      weapon to another just as fingerprints vary from one person to
      another.  Like fingerprints, the lands and grooves scratched onto
      the surface of the bullet can be microscopically identified with a
      particular weapon to the exclusion of all others, provided that
      they remain sufficiently intact subsequent to impact (R547-48).
         The very fine lands and grooves along the copper sides of CE 399
      allowed the conclusive determination that the bullet had been fired
      from "Oswald's" rifle.  FBI agent Frazier provided vital testimony
      about the defacement of these microscopic markings on 399:

            Mr. Eisenberg:  Were the markings of the bullet at all
         defaced?
            Mr. Frazier:  Yes;  they were, in that the bullet is
         distorted by having been slightly flattened or twisted.
            Mr. Eisenberg:  How material would you call that
         defacement?
            Mr. Frazier:  It is hardly visible unless you look at the
         base of the bullet and notice it is not round.
            Mr. Eisenberg:  How far does it affect your examination
         for purposes of identification?
            Mr. Frazier:  It had no effect at all . . . because it
         did not mutilate or distort the microscopic marks beyond the
         point where you could recognize the pattern and find the
         same pattern of marks on one bullet as were present on the
         other. (3H430)

      From Frazier's testimony it is apparent that the very slight
      "defacement" of 399's lands and grooves could be better termed a
      "displacement," for the microscopic marks were distorted only by an
      almost insignificant change in the {contour} of the bullet as
      opposed to a disruption in the continuity of the surface.
         After closely examining 399 at a magnification of five
      diameters, I was convinced of the veracity of Frazier's testimony.
      I followed each set of lands and grooves on the bullet and saw that
      all were continuous and without disruption, beginning just below
      the rounded nose and running smoothly down to the tail end.
         Dr. Fillinger emphasized to me that a jacketed bullet such as
      399 could strike one bone and leave its lands and grooves intact so
      far as visible {to the naked eye}.  When I assured him that Agent
      Frazier had found these marks still to be intact even through
      microscopic examination, Fillinger seemed somewhat taken aback.
      "Well, this is unlikely," he said.  "It's very unlikely, as a
      matter of fact.  Even our own ballistics people here don't get that
      kind of good luck."[10]  One can readily appreciate that forceful
      contact with firm bone tissue is bound to disrupt the fine
      striations on a bullet's surface, even with a jacketed projectile.
         If 399 wounded Governor Connally, then it was necessarily immune
      to the conditions that distort and deform other bullets of its
      kind.  If it smashed through two substantial bones and rammed into
      another one, it failed to manifest the normal indications of such a
      flight, those which marked other bullets under even less stress.
      The theory that 399 wounded the Governor is valid only on the
      premise that it was a magic bullet capable of feats never before
      performed in the history of ballistics.
         Bullet 399 is not magic.  It is just the typical mass of copper
      and lead that constitutes other bullets of its kind.  Governor
      Connally was likewise not magic.  His flesh and bones would deform
      bullets as would anyone else's;  his wounds showed very strong
      indications that the bullet causing them had, in fact, become
      distorted and irregular.
         The only tenable conclusion warranted by the evidence of the
      Governor's wounds, the condition of 399, and the laws of physics is
      that 399 did not wound Governor Connally.


      {The Search for Legitimacy}

         Did 399 figure in the assassination shots?
         As we have seen, there is no possible way by which bullet 399
      can be related to the President's wounds.  The extensive
      fragmentation involving the fatal wounds rules out a missile left
      intact.  The presence of fragments in the President's neck likewise
      rules out 399, for there is no possible circumstance under which it
      could have deposited fragments in the neck and still account for
      the other wounds, such as the tiny hole in the throat.  Had the
      President sustained a back wound of short penetration, it could not
      have been caused by a bullet whose penetrating power was as great
      as 399's.
         Governor Connally, to judge from the nature of his wounds and
      the predictable consequences of a strike such as he endured, was
      hit by a missile that did not leave behind a very large percentage
      of its substance but ended its flight in a distorted or mangled
      condition.
         Thus, CE 399 can not be related to any of the wounds inflicted
      on either victim during the assassination.  From this it follows
      that 399 must have turned up at Parkland Hospital in a manner not
      related to the victims and their treatment.  It had to have been
      placed on the stretcher at some time, manually and intentionally.
         It can not be a legitimate assassination bullet.
         The situation at Parkland on the afternoon of the assassination
      would have enabled almost anyone to gain access to the area where
      399 was discovered on the stretcher.  A man identifying himself as
      an FBI agent tried to enter the room in which the dead President
      lay at the hospital.  The Secret Servicemen who witnessed this
      incident and had to restrain the man with force reported that he
      "appeared to be {determined} to enter the President's room"
      (18H798-99 and 795-96).  The Commission apparently made no efforts
      to determine the identity of this man and sought no further details
      from other witnesses.
         Two witnesses were positive that they saw Jack Ruby at Parkland
      Hospital at about the time the President's death was announced
      (15H80;  25H216).
         Harold Weisberg, in his book "Oswald in New Orleans," reveals
      that a Cuban refugee of "disruptive influence" was employed at
      Parkland at the time of the assassination.  Pointing out that the
      Commission's best evidence indicated that 399 was a "plant,"
      Weisberg finds it extremely suspicious that no effort was made to
      identify this "political Cuban" when his existence was known to
      both the Secret Service and the Commission.[11]  Such a man would
      have had access to the stretcher on which 399 was found and would
      not have attracted the least suspicion, since he was an employee of
      the hospital.
         Nurse Margaret Henchcliffe related an incident that illustrates
      how almost {anyone} could have made his way to the area of the
      stretcher.  She reported that a 16-year-old boy {carrying a camera}
      had gotten into the Emergency Area, seeking to take pictures of the
      room in which the President had died less than an hour before
      (21H240).
         There is currently no evidence against the possibility that the
      two bullet fragments found in the front seat of the limousine and
      traced to "Oswald's" rifle were likewise "planted" after the
      victims were taken to the hospital.  We should recall from the
      discussion of the President's head wounds that the fatal damage
      was, in no instance, consistent with the damage produced by
      military ammunition of the type attributed to Oswald.  Photographs
      taken outside the hospital show substantial crowds in proximity to
      the unguarded limousine.[12]  As in the case of the stretcher
      bullet, the circumstances {did} permit incriminating evidence to be
      planted.
         It cannot be said, and indeed I make no pretense of saying, that
      a phony FBI man, a "disruptive Cuban," Jack Ruby, or a young boy
      with a camera planted bullet 399 at Parkland Hospital.  The thrust
      of this discussion has been that anyone could have gained access to
      the locations in which evidence pointing to Oswald was found.  This
      point may also be applied to the Book Depository, where Oswald's
      rifle and three spent shells were discovered.  Within fifteen
      minutes of the assassination, the Depository was swarming with
      unidentified people.[13]  The medical evidence, as the discussion
      in this and the previous chapter demonstrates, disassociates
      military bullets from the President's wounds and proves that a
      specific bullet traced to Oswald's rifle and found at Parkland
      could {not} have wounded either victim in the assassination.  The
      spectrographic analyses, the only evidence that could correlate
      Oswald's rifle with the wounds, was conspicuously avoided by the
      Commission, and has been suppressed by the government so that no
      one to this day may know the spectrographer's findings.  It is
      therefore not unreasonable to postulate, in accordance with the
      only scientific evidence currently available, that the tangible
      evidence that implicates Oswald was deliberately "planted," and did
      not figure in the actual shooting.  The unmistakable inference from
      the medical evidence is that the rifle, the cartridge cases, and
      the bullets {had} to have been planted.  The circumstances at the
      Book Depository and at Parkland Hospital indisputably could have
      enabled a "conspirator" to plant evidence pointing to Oswald.  The
      Commission has produced no evidence that precludes the possibility
      of a "plant."



         The discussion in this section has removed the very foundation
      of the official case against Oswald by demonstrating, to the degree
      of certainty possible, that Oswald's rifle was not responsible for
      the wounds of President Kennedy and Governor Connally.  The
      medical/ballistics evidence thus exculpates Oswald and presents
      several unmistakable conspiratorial implications.
         The Warren Commission claimed to have much evidence, apart from
      the medical/ballistics findings, that proved or indicated that
      Oswald was the assassin.  This additional evidence, and the
      Commission's treatment of it, I will consider in Part III.

      SIXTH and SEVENTH PAGES:


      Extreme close-up of the tail end of Bullet 399, shown in relation
      to a millimeter scale.  This photograph reveals the sole deformity
      of this so-called magic bullet:  there has been a slight squeezing
      at the base with some disruption of the lead core that is exposed
      at that point.  It is difficult to believe that this bullet could
      emerge so unscathed after penetrating two bodies, smashing two
      bones, and brushing another, as the Warren Commission alleges.
      However, it is {impossible} for this bullet to have left the lead
      fragments demanded if it is a legitimate assassination bullet.
      Metal fragments, some with dimensions greater than 3mm., were left
      behind at each point 399 is alleged to have hit:  The President's
      neck, and the Governor's chest, wrist, and thigh.  As this
      photograph reveals, such an array of fragments could not have come
      from 399's base, thus disassociating 399 from the shooting.  The
      one area of 399's lead base that is missing appears as a small
      crater in this photograph;  this is the result of FBI Agent
      Frazier's having removed a slug of lead for spectographic analysis.

      EIGHTH and NINTH PAGES:


      Suppressed Skull X rays--These [2] X rays depict gelatin-filled
      human skulls shot with ammunition of the type allegedly used by
      Oswald.  They were classified by the government and remained
      suppressed until recently;  they are printed here for the first
      time ever.  What they reveal is that Oswald's rifle could not have
      produced the head wounds suffered by President Kennedy.  The bullet
      that hit the president in the head exploded into a multitude of
      minuscule fragments.  One Secret Service agent described the
      appearance of these metal fragments on the X rays:  "The whole head
      looked like a little mass of stars."  The fragmentation depicted on
      these test X rays obviously differs from that described in the
      president's head.  The upper X ray reveals only relatively large
      fragments concentrated at the point of entrance;  the lower reveals
      only a few tiny fragments altogether.  This gives dramatic,
      suppressed proof that Oswald did not fire the shot that killed
      President Kennedy.  (Photo:  National Archives)
