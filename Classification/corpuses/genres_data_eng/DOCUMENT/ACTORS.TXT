Welcome to the latest version of THE ACTORS LIST. This month it has been
split into six parts.

The next release of the movie database scripts will be published next week
along with the dead list.

Please feel free to submit entries for actors not already on the list.  The 
inclusion criteria are:

 * The actor must still be alive

 * I receive more than one request to include the actor

If you have any corrections/suggestions etc please respond by e-mail only.
For details on how you can make it easier for me to incorporate your changes
see the paragraph at the end of part VI of the list.

Readers who are new to rec.arts.movies or who are unfamiliar with the way that
the list operates should read the policy note at the end of part VI.

The following table gives details of the lists available:

SUBMITTING ADDITIONS
====================

I will accept additions in any form you choose, but would be really 
grateful if you could follow these guidelines:

* for each addition, include on a separate line an entry of the form:

'Surname, First Name|Title|Attributes'.

The attributes field is used to record details of any award nominations or
wins and in most cases will be blank. If you are uncertain about whether to
include anything in this field, leave it blank.

e.g.

Biehn, Michael|Abyss, The|
Biehn, Michael|Terminator, The|

or

Day-Lewis, Daniel|My Left Foot|(AA)

* If you know of more than one film with the same title & you know the year,
  please include the details.

e.g.

Russell, Kurt|Thing, The (1982)|

If you follow these guidelines, it will make it so much easier to maintain
the list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

POLICY NOTE FOR NEW READERS
===========================

There are currently six lists (actors/actresses/directors/dead/writers/
composers) posted at regular intervals to this newsgroup. I only maintain the 
actors and dead lists.  The lists are intended to provide useful, upto date 
references to film and TV appearances in an electronic form. None of them are 
comprehensive and nor could they ever hope to be (due to the sheer volume of 
movies being produced). I rely on r.a.m. readers to submit corrections and 
additions to keep the list as accurate and complete as possible. The absence of
any particular actor or movie from this list does not reflect any bias on my 
part. It simply means that no one has sent me the information. So if you notice
that something is missing, *please* e-mail the details to me. Thanks.
