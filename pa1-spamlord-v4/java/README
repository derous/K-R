We've provided the basic requirements for building and running with a variety of tools.

ECLIPSE:
We've provided .project and .classpath files, which you can directly import into eclipse. To do this, select File -> Import.  In the dialog box which pops up, expand the folder called "General" and choose the option "Existing Projects into Workspace".  Finally, set the root directory to be the java directory within the original project directory: pa1-spamlord-vn/java.  The project is already set up to pass in the arguments "../data/dev ../data/devGOLD" under the run configuraiton called "Develop", so make sure you do not change the directory structure.  To submit your assignment you can use "Submit" run configuration and enter your e-mail and password in the Eclipse Console.  Also, the .classpath file should already include the submit dependency json-simple-1.1.1.jar.


ANT:
we've provided a basic build.xml file for use with ant.  Just call:

$ ant compile
$ ant run
$ ant submit


MAKE:
We've also given a makefile with the rules for compiling, developing and submitting your code:
  all: compiles both SpamLord and Submit
  run: runs SpamLord on development set
  submit: runs submit code and prompts for login and password
  clean: removes .class files


COMMAND LINE:
If you want to develop on the command line, use the following commands to build and run your code:

$ mkdir classes
$ javac -d classes *.java
# test on dev set
$ java -cp "classes" SpamLord
# submit
$ java -cp "json-simple-1.1.1.jar:classes" Submit

Note: it is important to run all of the above commands from the pa1-spamlord-vn/java directory
